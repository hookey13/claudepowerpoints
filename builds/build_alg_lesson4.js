const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Session 4. Today we put our properties to work
- We have learned commutative, associative, and distributive. Now we use them to find unknown values
- This is where algebra gets exciting -- you become number detectives

DO:
- Display title slide
- Have whiteboards ready

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 4 of 10. This is the payoff lesson -- students apply the properties learned in Sessions 1-3 to find unknown values in equations. The curriculum elaboration (3 x 5 = 30 / ?, 3 x 4 = ? x 2) is directly addressed.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who remember the properties from Sessions 2-3 -- build confidence

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Daily review. Factors and multiples
- Find the common factors of each pair of numbers
- Write them on your whiteboards

DO:
- Display problems
- Allow 2 minutes
- Watch for systematic listing

TEACHER NOTES:
DR reviews factors and common factors. Finding common factors is directly useful for today's work -- when students see 3 x 4 = ? x 2, recognising that 4 = 2 x 2 (common factor 2) is the key insight.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who list all factors of both numbers then circle the common ones -- systematic approach
- Students who only find one or two common factors -- may miss some

[Stage 1: Daily Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check your answers
- Ask: What are the common factors of 12 and 18? [1, 2, 3, 6]
- Knowing common factors helps us rewrite expressions -- you will see why today

DO:
- Reveal answers, students self-check

TEACHER NOTES:
Link to today's lesson: common factors enable us to decompose and recompose expressions to find unknowns.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who found all common factors -- strong number sense

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency -- factor pairs. Write all factor pairs for each number as fast as you can
- Go!

DO:
- Display 5 numbers for factor pair listing
- Time 2 minutes
- Self-check

TEACHER NOTES:
Factor pair fluency is essential for today. Students who can quickly identify that 12 = 3x4 = 2x6 = 1x12 will find unknown-solving much easier.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who list systematically vs randomly
- Students who miss pairs -- factor knowledge needs continued fluency work

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention with me
- Read from slide: "We are learning to find unknown values in multiplication and division equations"
- Today we use everything we have learned so far to find the missing number
- Read our success criteria

DO:
- Choral read LI and SC

TEACHER NOTES:
This lesson targets the core curriculum outcome: finding unknowns in equations like 3 x 5 = 30 / ? and 3 x 4 = ? x 2. The three properties from Sessions 1-3 are the tools.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are eager to try -- the detective metaphor builds engagement

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Watch me find the unknown. 3 x 5 = 30 / ?
- First, I work out the left side: 3 x 5 = 15
- So the equation becomes: 15 = 30 / ?
- Now I ask: what number divides into 30 to give 15?
- 30 / ? = 15. I know 30 / 2 = 15. So ? = 2.
- Check: 3 x 5 = 15, and 30 / 2 = 15. Both sides equal 15. It works!

DO:
- Write each step clearly
- Circle the left side result (15) and show how it becomes the target for the right side
- Emphasise the "evaluate one side, then solve the other" strategy

TEACHER NOTES:
The strategy is: evaluate the known side, then use the result to find the unknown on the other side. This is the first systematic approach to solving equations.

MISCONCEPTIONS:
- Misconception: Students try to "do something" to both sides simultaneously without first evaluating
  Why: They have seen cross-multiplication or balancing in older contexts and try to apply half-remembered procedures
  Impact: Leads to procedural errors and confusion
  Quick correction: "Start simple. Work out the side you CAN calculate. That tells you what the other side must equal. Then find the missing piece."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who see the answer immediately -- celebrate but insist on showing the method
- Students who get stuck at "what divides 30 to give 15" -- factor knowledge gap

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Second type. 3 x 4 = ? x 2
- Left side: 3 x 4 = 12
- So ? x 2 = 12. What times 2 equals 12? 6.
- But WHY does this work? Let me show you using the associative property
- 3 x 4 = 3 x (2 x 2) = (3 x 2) x 2 = 6 x 2
- So the unknown is 6 because we can split 4 into 2 x 2, then regroup
- This is the associative property in action!

DO:
- Write the evaluation method first (quick solve)
- Then show the property-based reasoning (deep understanding)
- Both give the same answer -- connect them

TEACHER NOTES:
Two paths to the answer: (1) evaluate-and-solve (procedural), (2) property-based reasoning (conceptual). Students need both. The procedural path is fast, the conceptual path builds algebraic understanding for secondary school.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who can do the procedural solve but do not see the property connection -- guide them through the decomposition
- Students who see both paths -- strong algebraic thinking

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. Find the unknown.
- 5 x 6 = ? x 10
- Work out the left side first. Then find what times 10 gives that value.
- Whiteboards. 15 seconds.

DO:
- Students write on whiteboards
- Scan for ? = 3

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Show Me Boards
Script:
- Say: "5 x 6 = ? x 10. Work out the left side, then find the unknown. Show me."
- Scan for: 3 (since 5 x 6 = 30, and 30 / 10 = 3, so ? = 3).
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 3, move to We Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students write 30 (they evaluated the left side but forgot to divide by 10 to find the unknown). Reteach: "Left side = 30. So ? x 10 = 30. What times 10 equals 30? Not 30 -- that would be 30 x 10 = 300. Think: ? x 10 = 30. So ? = 3."

TEACHER NOTES:
Tests the core skill: evaluate one side, then solve for the unknown on the other side.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who write 30 instead of 3 -- they stopped at evaluation and did not solve
- Students who get 3 instantly -- the strategy is clicking

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- With your partner, find the unknown in each equation
- Show your working: evaluate one side, then solve the other

DO:
- Display four problems
- Partners work on whiteboards
- Circulate, listen for strategy talk
- Allow 3 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do problems mix multiplication and division unknowns. Problem 4 connects to the associative property explicitly.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 4 Enabling Scaffold which guides students through each step: (1) work out the left side, (2) write "the right side must equal ___", (3) find the missing number. First two problems are completed as models.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 4 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Create equations with given solutions. Given that ? = 8, write three different equations where 8 is the unknown. Use at least two different operations. Then challenge a partner to solve them.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 4 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who evaluate correctly but make errors finding the unknown -- focus on the "what times/divided by gives" reasoning
- Readiness signal: partners completing all four within 2 minutes

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's check. 4 x 8 = ? x 4. Left = 32. ? x 4 = 32. ? = 8.
- 7 x 6 = 84 / ?. Left = 42. 84 / ? = 42. ? = 2.
- 9 x ? = 36. ? = 4 (since 9 x 4 = 36).
- 3 x 4 = ? x 2. Left = 12. ? x 2 = 12. ? = 6. Or: 3 x (2 x 2) = (3 x 2) x 2 = 6 x 2.

DO:
- Reveal one at a time
- For problem 4, show both the procedural and associative approaches
- Cold call for each

TEACHER NOTES:
Problem 4 mirrors the curriculum elaboration exactly. Showing both paths reinforces the connection between procedural solving and algebraic properties.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who can solve procedurally but struggle with the property explanation -- they may need more practice with associative decomposition
- Students who see both paths -- strong conceptual understanding

[Stage 3: We Do Answers | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge check. Cold call -- I will pick someone to answer
- Find the unknown: 15 / 3 = 30 / ?
- Think... what does the left side equal? What must the right side equal?

DO:
- Wait 10 seconds for thinking
- Cold call a student
- Follow up with a different student for justification

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Cold Call
Script:
- Say: "Everyone think. 15 / 3 = 30 / ?. What is the left side? [5] So 30 / ? must equal? [5]. What is ?... [Name], what did you get?"
- Scan for: ? = 6 (since 30 / 6 = 5).
PROCEED: If the cold-called student and 2 follow-ups get 6, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students say ? = 10 (dividing 30 by 3 instead of recognising the left side equals 5). Reteach: "Left side first: 15 / 3 = 5. Not 3 -- five. So we need 30 / ? = 5. What number goes into 30 five times? Count by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 -- that is 6 counts. So ? = 6."

TEACHER NOTES:
Division-based unknowns are harder because students must think about what divides into the dividend to give the quotient. This is inverse thinking.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who confuse the divisor with the quotient
- Students who get 6 confidently -- inverse thinking is developing

[Stage 3: CFU Hinge | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_YOUDO = `SAY:
- Independent practice. Your worksheet has equations with unknowns
- First: Work out the known side. Next: Write what the other side must equal. Then: Find the unknown.
- Show all working. 8 minutes.

DO:
- Distribute Session 4 Worksheet
- Students work independently
- Distribute enabling/extending as needed

TEACHER NOTES:
You Do uses different numbers from We Do. Problems progress from single-operation to mixed-operation equations. The challenge section asks students to write their own equations.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the step-by-step scaffold: evaluate, target, solve. Pre-filled models for first two problems.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 4 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Create equations with given solutions. Design at least 3 equations for each target value (8 and 15). Use multiple operations.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 4 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who can solve multiplication unknowns but struggle with division -- division inverse thinking needs more support
- Readiness signal: 80%+ completing 8+ problems correctly

[Stage 4: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EXIT = `SAY:
- Exit ticket. Three questions. 3 minutes. Work alone.

DO:
- Display questions, students work silently, collect to sort

TEACHER NOTES:
Q1 tests multiplication unknown (SC1). Q2 tests division unknown (SC2). Q3 tests justification with properties (SC3).

WATCH FOR:
- Students who solve Q1-Q2 but struggle with Q3 -- they can solve procedurally but not yet explain with properties

[Stage 5: Exit Ticket | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- Success criteria check.
- SC1: I can find an unknown in a multiplication equation. Thumbs?
- SC2: I can find an unknown in a division equation. Thumbs?
- SC3: I can explain my reasoning using number properties. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: What is your strategy for finding an unknown? Explain it step by step to your partner.

DO:
- Thumbs for each SC
- 30 seconds Turn and Talk
- Cold call 2 students

TEACHER NOTES:
The strategy summary (evaluate, target, solve) is the key takeaway. Students who can articulate this process have a transferable problem-solving approach.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who describe the three-step process clearly -- ready for consolidation in Session 5
- Students who are still unsure -- they need the scaffold again in Session 5
