// ─── Teacher Notes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- This is our last lesson on teen numbers this week
- Today we are going to show teen numbers in DIFFERENT ways
- You already know how to say them, write them, and use ten frames
- Now we will put it all together

DO:
- Display title slide
- Have whiteboards, counters, and ten frames ready

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 5 of 5. This consolidation lesson pulls together naming, writing, ten frame representation, and number words. Multiple representations deepen understanding -- students who can show 14 as a numeral, a word, a ten frame, and as objects have flexible number sense.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who seem confident -- they have consolidated well across the week
- Students who are still shaky on one mode (e.g., can say but not write) -- note for future planning

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Let's warm up with some sorting
- Look at these objects. Sort them into two groups.
- Group 1: things that are red. Group 2: things that are NOT red.
- Then try the second sort: things with wheels, things without wheels.

DO:
- Display the sorting challenge (pictures of objects)
- Students call out which group each object belongs in
- Use whiteboards for the second sort

TEACHER NOTES:
Daily Review practises data collection (sorting and classifying). This is a Term 1 concept being retrieved. Sorting requires the same categorical thinking used when classifying number representations.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who sort quickly and confidently -- classification skills are strong
- Students who put objects in the wrong group -- they may need clearer criteria

[Stage 1: Daily Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check: the apple is red, the car is red, the leaf is NOT red, the ball is red, the book is NOT red
- Wheels: car and bike have wheels. Apple, book, ball do not.
- Sorting means putting things into groups that belong together

DO:
- Click to reveal sorted groups
- Students check their answers
- Briefly connect: "Today we will sort different WAYS to show numbers"

TEACHER NOTES:
The bridge to today's lesson: sorting objects into groups is the same skill as matching different representations of the same number.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who see the connection to numbers -- strong transfer thinking

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency time. Today we are going to count from different starting points.
- Do not always start at 1! Sometimes we start in the middle.
- Ready? Count from 5 to 15 with me. 5, 6, 7, 8...
- Now count from 11 to 20. 11, 12, 13...
- Now count from 8 to 18. 8, 9, 10, 11...

DO:
- Lead choral counts from different starting points
- 3 rounds: 5-15, 11-20, 8-18
- Keep it brisk
- Students count chorally, getting louder on teen numbers

TEACHER NOTES:
Counting from various starting points builds flexible number sense. Students who can only count from 1 have a rigid chain -- starting from 5 or 11 requires genuine understanding of the sequence.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who hesitate when starting from 8 or 11 -- they rely on counting from 1
- Students who jump in confidently from any starting point -- flexible counting is developing

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention with me
- Read from slide: "We are learning to show teen numbers in different ways"
- Our success criteria: read each one.
- Ask: What ways do we already know to show a teen number? [Say it, write it, ten frame]

DO:
- Choral read LI and SC
- Quick brainstorm of representation types already learned

TEACHER NOTES:
This lesson consolidates all representation modes from the week. SC1 is the floor (show with objects/drawings). SC2 is the core (ten frame). SC3 extends to matching across all modes.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who name multiple representations -- they have been tracking the week's learning
- Students who only remember one way -- the lesson will expand their repertoire

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Watch me show the number 14 in FOUR different ways
- Way 1: I say it. Fourteen.
- Way 2: I write it. 1-4. Fourteen.
- Way 3: I draw it on a ten frame. Full ten plus 4 extras.
- Way 4: I use objects. 14 counters -- 10 in a line, 4 more.
- All four ways show the SAME number: 14.

DO:
- Point to each representation on screen as you model it
- Emphasise "same number, different ways"
- Have physical counters to demonstrate Way 4

TEACHER NOTES:
Multiple representations build flexible number sense. The key insight for students is that 14, fourteen, a ten frame with 4 extras, and 14 counters are all the same thing shown differently. This is an early equivalence concept.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who nod along -- they see the connection between representations
- Students who look surprised that they are all the same -- the connection is new and important

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Let me show you another number: 17
- I say it: seventeen
- I write it: 1-7
- Ten frame: full ten plus 7 extras
- Now let me show you 20 in four ways
- I say it: twenty. I write it: 2-0
- Ten frame: two full ten frames
- Objects: 20 counters in two groups of 10

DO:
- Model each representation for 17 and 20
- For 20, emphasise the difference (2 tens, not 1 ten plus extras)

TEACHER NOTES:
Modelling two more numbers embeds the pattern. Including 20 reminds students of the special case where both tens are full.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who can predict the ten frame before you draw it -- they are transferring the structure
- Students who remember that 20 is two tens -- Session 2 learning has stuck

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. I will show you a teen number in ONE way. You show me another way.
- I show you a ten frame with a full ten and 6 extras. What number is this?
- Write it on your whiteboard!

DO:
- Display ten frame showing 16
- Students write 16 on whiteboards
- Follow up: "Now say it to your partner" (oral representation)

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Show Me Boards
Script:
- Say: "I am showing you a ten frame. Full ten, 6 extras. Write the NUMBER on your whiteboard. Show me!"
- Scan for: 16. Students who write 16 are converting between ten frame and numeral representations.
PROCEED: If 80%+ write 16, move to We Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students write 6 (reading only the extras, not including the ten). Reteach: "The full ten frame means 10. Plus 6 extras. 10 and 6 is 16. Always include the 10!"

TEACHER NOTES:
This CFU checks cross-representation transfer -- from visual (ten frame) to symbolic (numeral). This is the core skill for the lesson.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who convert instantly -- representation fluency is strong
- Readiness signal: 16 written quickly and correctly

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- Partner time. I will show you a number. You need to show it THREE ways.
- Way 1: Write the numeral
- Way 2: Draw a ten frame
- Way 3: Say it to your partner
- First number: 13!

DO:
- Display the number 13 (written large)
- Partners work together: write numeral, draw ten frame, say it
- Then repeat for 18 and 15
- Circulate and check ten frame drawings especially

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do asks students to produce three representations from a given number. This is the reverse of I Do (where the teacher produced them). Different numbers from I Do ensures genuine practice.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 5 Enabling Scaffold with guided matching. Students draw a line from a numeral to its matching ten frame picture. Pre-drawn visuals reduce production demands.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 5 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 5 Extension to create a teen numbers poster page showing each number 11-20 in all four representations (numeral, word, ten frame, tally marks).
- Extra Notes: Self-contained creative task.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who draw accurate ten frames quickly -- visual representation is secure
- Students who struggle with the ten frame drawing but write the numeral correctly -- drawing needs more practice

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's check. 13: numeral is 1-3. Say it: thirteen. Ten frame: full ten plus 3 extras.
- 18: numeral is 1-8. Say it: eighteen. Ten frame: full ten plus 8 extras.
- 15: numeral is 1-5. Say it: fifteen. Ten frame: full ten plus 5 extras.

DO:
- Reveal representations for each number
- Students compare their ten frame drawings
- Celebrate accurate representations

TEACHER NOTES:
Confirming all three representations side by side reinforces the equivalence -- same number, different forms.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who self-correct their ten frames -- they are learning from the model
- Students whose three representations all match -- flexible number sense is developing

[Stage 3: We Do Answers | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge check. I am going to show you two things. Do they show the SAME number?
- A ten frame with full ten and 5 extras... and the numeral 15. Same number?
- Thumbs up for YES, thumbs down for NO.

DO:
- Students show thumbs (should be up -- both show 15)
- Then: "A ten frame with full ten and 3 extras... and the numeral 14. Same number?"
- Thumbs down (ten frame shows 13, not 14)

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Thumbs Up/Down
Script:
- Say: "Thumbs up if they match, thumbs down if they do not. Ten frame: full ten plus 5 extras. Numeral: 15. Same number? Show me."
- Scan for: thumbs up. Then: "Ten frame: full ten plus 3 extras. Numeral: 14. Same number? Show me."
- Scan for: thumbs down (ten frame = 13, not 14).
PROCEED: If 80%+ get both correct, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students show thumbs up for both because they assume the teacher always shows matching pairs. Reteach: "Count the extras carefully. 1, 2, 3. That is 3 extras. 10 and 3 is 13. But the numeral says 14. 13 and 14 are NOT the same number."

TEACHER NOTES:
The mismatch example is critical -- it confirms students are actually checking, not just agreeing.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who catch the mismatch instantly -- strong cross-representation checking
- Readiness signal: confident thumbs down with explanation that "ten frame shows 13, not 14"

[Stage 3: CFU Hinge | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_YOUDO = `SAY:
- Independent practice. Your worksheet has three sections.
- First: Match the numeral to the ten frame. Next: Draw ten frames for given numbers. Then: Write the numeral and draw the ten frame for each number word.
- You have 7 minutes.

DO:
- Distribute Session 5 Worksheet
- Students work independently
- Circulate: check ten frame drawings and numeral-to-representation matching
- Distribute scaffolds/extensions as needed

TEACHER NOTES:
You Do requires all three representation conversions: numeral to ten frame, ten frame to numeral, and word to both. Different content from We Do ensures independent application.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Complete the enabling scaffold with pre-drawn ten frames to match. Students draw lines from numerals to the correct ten frame picture. No drawing required.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 5 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Create a teen numbers poster using the Session 5 Extension. Show each number 11-20 with all four representations (numeral, word, ten frame, tally marks).
- Extra Notes: Self-contained creative investigation.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who complete all three sections accurately -- representation fluency is strong
- Students who match correctly but struggle to draw ten frames -- production is harder than recognition
- Readiness signal: completing 8+ items correctly in 5 minutes

[Stage 4: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EXIT = `SAY:
- Final exit ticket of the week! Three questions.
- Work on your own. 2 minutes.

DO:
- Display exit ticket
- Students respond on whiteboards
- Sort for end-of-unit assessment data

TEACHER NOTES:
Exit ticket assesses all three SC across the week. Q1 checks representation (drawing). Q2 checks cross-representation matching. Q3 checks understanding of structure. This data informs whether the unit needs revision in future weeks.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who get all three -- teen numbers unit is secure
- Students who struggle with any question -- note the specific gap for future planning

[Stage 5: Exit Ticket | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- What a week! Let's check our success criteria one last time.
- SC1: I can show a teen number using objects or drawings. Thumbs?
- SC2: I can use a ten frame to represent teen numbers 11-20. Thumbs?
- SC3: I can match a teen number to its ten frame, numeral, and word. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: How many ways can you show the number 16? Tell your partner all the ways!

DO:
- Display SC
- Thumbs check
- Turn and Talk
- Cold call 2-3 students -- celebrate multiple representations

TEACHER NOTES:
The final closing celebrates a full week of learning. The Turn and Talk asks students to demonstrate the core skill: showing a number in multiple ways. Students who can name 3+ representations (numeral, word, ten frame, objects) have flexible teen number knowledge.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who name 3-4 ways -- strong consolidation
- Students who name 1-2 ways -- they have a foundation to build on next week

[General: Closing | VTLM 2.0: Review and Reflect]`;

const NOTES_RESOURCES = `SAY:
- Here are this week's resources for the final session

DO:
- Point out resources

TEACHER NOTES:
Resource slide for Session 5.
