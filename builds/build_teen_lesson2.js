// ─── Teacher Notes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Yesterday we met the teen numbers 11 to 15
- Today we are going to learn the rest -- 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20
- By the end of today, you will know ALL the teen numbers

DO:
- Display title slide as students settle
- Have counters and ten frames ready

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 2 of 5. Extends the teen number concept to 16-20. Students who grasped the pattern in Session 1 should transfer it easily. The key challenge is 20, where the extras row is completely full.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who remember "ten and some more" from yesterday -- prior learning is intact

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Let's practise writing our teen numbers
- I will show you some numbers. Write each one on your whiteboard
- Make your numbers nice and clear

DO:
- Display the numbers to write: 11, 14, 13, 15, 12
- Allow 10 seconds per number
- Students write on whiteboards and hold up

TEACHER NOTES:
Daily Review practises digit formation for teen numbers from Session 1. Writing reinforces recognition. After the break, fine motor skills may need warming up.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who reverse digits (writing 41 instead of 14) -- this is common at Foundation
- Students who form digits correctly and quickly -- fine motor and number recognition are strong

[Stage 1: Daily Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check your numbers. Do they match?
- Fix any that are different
- Remember: the 1 comes first in all teen numbers (11, 12, 13, 14, 15)

DO:
- Click to reveal correct formations
- Students compare and fix
- Point out the 1 at the start of every teen number

TEACHER NOTES:
Tick-and-fix for digit formation. The "1 comes first" observation reinforces the tens-and-ones structure from a writing perspective.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who reversed digits -- address privately, not publicly
- Students who self-corrected -- metacognition is developing

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency time -- today we are counting BACKWARDS
- Start at 10 and count back to 1 with me
- 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... blast off!
- Now let's try it faster. Ready? Go!

DO:
- Lead backward count 10 to 1 (whole class, 3 rounds)
- Round 1: normal pace
- Round 2: faster
- Round 3: whisper count
- Use hand gestures (lowering hand as numbers decrease)

TEACHER NOTES:
Backward counting builds number sequence flexibility. Students who can only count forward have a rigid number sense. Backward counting from 10 is achievable for most Foundation students and prepares for subtraction concepts later.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who hesitate at 7 or 6 -- the middle of the sequence is often less automatic
- Students who count back fluently -- backward counting is automated

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention with me
- Read from slide: "We are learning to name and recognise the numbers 16 to 20"
- Now our success criteria. Let's read them together.
- Ask: What did we learn about teen numbers yesterday? [They have a ten and some more]

DO:
- Choral read LI and SC
- Quick recall of yesterday's key idea
- Accept and affirm student responses

TEACHER NOTES:
Connecting to Session 1 activates prior knowledge. SC1 is the floor (saying 16-20). SC2 is the core target (representing with ten frames). SC3 extends to explaining the structure.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who remember "ten and some more" -- Session 1 learning has stuck
- Students who seem unsure -- they may need a quick recap before I Do

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Yesterday we learned 11 to 15. Today we keep going
- Watch me. 16 = ten and 6 more. Six-teen. Hear "six" in "sixteen"?
- 17 = ten and 7 more. Seven-teen. Hear "seven" in "seventeen"?
- 18 = ten and 8 more. Eight-teen. Hear "eight" in "eighteen"?
- The pattern is the same. Full ten frame plus extras.

DO:
- Build each number on the ten frame visual
- Point to the extras for each
- Have students repeat each number name
- Emphasise the consistent pattern

TEACHER NOTES:
This I Do follows the same structure as Session 1 to build consistency. The naming pattern is very transparent for 16-18 (six-teen, seven-teen, eight-teen), which helps students see the structure in the name itself.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who predict the next number before you build it -- pattern recognition is strong
- Students who can hear the ones digit in the name -- phonological-numerical connection is forming

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Now the tricky ones. 19 = ten and 9 more. Nine-teen.
- And 20. Twenty is special. Watch.
- 20 = ten and 10 more. That means BOTH rows of the ten frame are full!
- 20 is actually TWO tens. Two full ten frames.
- That is why we call it twenty -- two-ty means two tens.

DO:
- Build 19 on the ten frame (full ten + 9 extras)
- Build 20: show both the ten frame completely full AND two separate full ten frames
- Emphasise that 20 = 2 tens

TEACHER NOTES:
20 is the conceptual leap. It is the first time students see a number made of two complete tens with no extras. This is the bridge to understanding place value. Do not rush this -- let the visual speak.

MISCONCEPTIONS:
- Misconception: 20 follows the same "teen" pattern as 11-19
  Why: Students generalise the "ten and ones" pattern without realising 20 is qualitatively different -- it has no leftover ones
  Impact: If students do not see 20 as "two tens," they will struggle with the decade numbers (30, 40, 50) later
  Quick correction: "20 is special. There are no extras left over. Both rows are completely full. That is two whole tens."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who look surprised when both rows fill up -- they are noticing something new
- Students who say "two tens" or "both full" -- conceptual understanding is emerging

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. I am going to show you a ten frame
- Count the full ten and the extras
- Write the number on your whiteboard. Ready... show me.

DO:
- Display a ten frame showing 17 (full ten + 7 extras)
- Students write on whiteboards
- Scan for 17

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Show Me Boards
Script:
- Say: "Look at this ten frame. Full ten plus extras. Write the number on your whiteboard. You have 5 seconds. Show me."
- Scan for: 17. Students who write 17 quickly can read the ten frame for numbers beyond 15.
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 17, move to the We Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students write 7 (counting only the extras, forgetting the ten). Reteach: "Remember, the full ten frame means we start at 10. Then we count the extras: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So it is 10 and 7 more -- 17. Always start with 10."

TEACHER NOTES:
This CFU checks transfer from Session 1 to the new numbers 16-20. If students can read 17 from a ten frame, the concept has generalised.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who write 7 instead of 17 -- they are counting extras without the ten
- Readiness signal: students writing 17 without hesitation

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- Partner time. I will show you ten frames for bigger teen numbers
- Work together. Count the ten, count the extras, write the number
- Hold up your whiteboards when ready

DO:
- Display ten frames for 16, 19, 18, 20 one at a time
- Partners discuss and write on whiteboards
- Allow 15-20 seconds per number

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do uses the new numbers 16-20. Including 20 checks whether students recognise the two-tens structure. Different content from Session 1 We Do ensures genuine practice, not recall.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 2 Enabling Scaffold with pre-shaded ten frames for 16, 17, 18. Students count extras and write the number with visual cues.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 2 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: After identifying each number, use the Session 2 Extension to match ALL teen numbers 11-20 to their ten frame representations and explore what comes after 20.
- Extra Notes: Self-contained investigation with visual examples.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who correctly identify 20 as "two full tens" -- they understand the leap beyond teen
- Students who write 10 for the 20 frame -- they may be reading only the extras row

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's check. First: full ten and 6 extras. [16] Sixteen!
- Second: full ten and 9 extras. [19] Nineteen! That is a lot of extras.
- Third: full ten and 8 extras. [18] Eighteen!
- Last one: BOTH rows full. No extras left. [20] Twenty! Two whole tens.

DO:
- Reveal answers one at a time
- Cold call for each
- For 20, emphasise "two tens, no extras"

TEACHER NOTES:
The reveal reinforces the naming pattern. Highlighting 20 as "two tens" is deliberate -- this is the most important conceptual moment in the session.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who self-correct -- learning is active
- Students who answered 20 correctly -- they have grasped the two-tens concept

[Stage 3: We Do Answers | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge check. I will say a number. You show me on your fingers how many EXTRAS it has after the ten.
- Ready? The number is 18. How many extras? Show me.
- Now: The number is 20. How many extras? Show me.

DO:
- Students show 8 fingers for 18
- Then 10 fingers (or "none -- it is two full tens") for 20
- Cold call to explain

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Finger Voting
Script:
- Say: "Show me on your fingers how many extras. 18 has how many extras? Show me." Scan for: 8 fingers.
- Then: "20 has how many extras? Show me." Scan for: students showing 10 fingers or saying "none" or "zero extras, it is two tens."
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 8 for 18, and most students recognise that 20 is different, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students show 0 fingers for 20 because they think "full = no extras." Clarify: "Good thinking! 20 has no LEFTOVER extras because the extras row is also full. 20 = 10 + 10. Two full tens."

TEACHER NOTES:
Two-part hinge checks both a standard teen number (18) and the conceptual outlier (20). The 20 question reveals depth of understanding.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who pause on 20 -- they are thinking, which is good
- Readiness signal: students explaining that 20 is "two tens" without prompting

[Stage 3: CFU Hinge | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_YOUDO = `SAY:
- Independent practice time
- On your worksheet you will see ten frames for numbers 16 to 20
- First: Count the ten and the extras. Next: Write the number. Then: Draw your own ten frames.
- You have 6 minutes.

DO:
- Distribute Session 2 Worksheet
- Students work independently
- Circulate: start with students who struggled during We Do
- Distribute enabling scaffold or extension as needed

TEACHER NOTES:
You Do covers 16-20 with different arrangements from the We Do. Section B asks students to draw counters for given numbers, checking they can represent as well as identify.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Complete the enabling scaffold with pre-shaded ten frames for 16, 17, 18. The tens are already drawn; students count extras and write the number.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 2 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 2 Extension to review all teen numbers 11-20, then investigate what comes after 20 using two ten frames.
- Extra Notes: Self-contained investigation.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who represent 20 correctly with two full ten frames -- deep understanding
- Students who complete Section A quickly -- direct to Section B (drawing)
- Readiness signal: completing 5+ problems correctly within 4 minutes

[Stage 4: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EXIT = `SAY:
- Exit ticket time. Three quick questions.
- Work on your own. 2 minutes.

DO:
- Display exit ticket
- Students respond on whiteboards
- Sort responses: secure, developing, beginning

TEACHER NOTES:
Exit ticket assesses SC1 (Q1 -- say/write 16-20) and SC2 (Q2 -- ten frame identification). Q3 targets SC3 (explain 20 as two tens).

WATCH FOR:
- Students who get Q1-Q2 correct but struggle with Q3 -- naming is secure but not structure
- Students who explain 20 clearly -- ready for ordering in Session 3

[Stage 5: Exit Ticket | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- Let's check our success criteria.
- SC1: I can say the numbers 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Thumbs?
- SC2: I can show a teen number using a ten frame and extra ones. Thumbs?
- SC3: I can explain what each teen number means using tens and ones. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: What is special about the number 20?

DO:
- Display SC on screen
- Run thumbs check
- Allow 30 seconds for Turn and Talk
- Cold call 2-3 students

TEACHER NOTES:
The Turn and Talk targets the key conceptual move: 20 = two tens. Students who can articulate this are ready for ordering the full 0-20 range in Session 3.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who say "two tens" or "both rows full" -- the concept has landed
- Students who are still unsure about 20 -- they need more support in future sessions

[General: Closing | VTLM 2.0: Review and Reflect]`;

const NOTES_RESOURCES = `SAY:
- These are today's resources

DO:
- Point out each resource

TEACHER NOTES:
Resource slide provides clickable links to all companion PDFs.

WATCH FOR:
- N/A
