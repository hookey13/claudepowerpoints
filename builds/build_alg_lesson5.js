const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Last session of Week 1. Today we bring it all together
- You have three properties in your toolkit: commutative, associative, and distributive
- You have a strategy for finding unknowns: evaluate, target, solve
- Today you use all of these on mixed problems

DO:
- Display title slide

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 5 of 10. Consolidation lesson -- no new content. Students apply all three properties and the evaluate-target-solve strategy to mixed problems. This builds fluency and confidence before Week 2 introduces brackets and order of operations.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are confident and ready for more challenge
- Students who still need support with specific properties

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Daily review -- fractions today
- Compare these fractions using < > or =
- Use what you know about equivalent fractions and benchmarks

DO:
- Display fraction comparison problems
- Allow 90 seconds
- Circulate

TEACHER NOTES:
DR on fractions is a different strand -- genuine spaced retrieval. Comparing and ordering fractions uses equivalence thinking (same value, different form) which parallels the algebraic equivalence work.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who convert to common denominators vs those who use benchmark reasoning (e.g., both close to 1/2)

[Stage 1: Daily Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check your answers
- Ask: How did you compare 3/4 and 5/8? [Convert to 6/8 and 5/8, so 3/4 > 5/8]

DO:
- Reveal answers, students self-check

TEACHER NOTES:
Fraction equivalence connects to algebraic equivalence -- both involve recognising that different forms can represent the same value.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who used benchmarks effectively vs those who needed common denominators

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency -- doubling and halving
- I say a number, you write the double AND the half
- Ready? Go.

DO:
- Display 8 numbers for doubling and halving
- Time 2 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
Doubling and halving connects to the commutative and associative properties (x2, /2 are key decomposition operations). Fast doubling/halving supports factor manipulation.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who double easily but struggle with halving odd numbers
- Students who are automatic on both

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention with me
- Read from slide: "We are learning to choose and apply the right property to solve unknown-value problems"
- Today there is no single strategy -- you choose which property to use
- Read our success criteria

DO:
- Choral read LI and SC

TEACHER NOTES:
The metacognitive demand increases -- students must select the appropriate property, not just apply a given one. This is the consolidation challenge.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are confident with the vocabulary (commutative, associative, distributive)

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Watch me solve a mixed problem. I need to choose the right tool.
- 6 x 8 = ? x 4
- Step 1: Left side = 48. Step 2: ? x 4 = 48. Step 3: ? = 12.
- But which property explains this? I can split 8 into 2 x 4:
- 6 x 8 = 6 x (2 x 4) = (6 x 2) x 4 = 12 x 4. Associative property!
- Now a different one: 7 x 14. I use distributive to make it easier.
- 7 x (10 + 4) = 70 + 28 = 98.
- The key is choosing the right tool for the job.

DO:
- Show both examples, naming the property each time
- Emphasise the decision-making process

TEACHER NOTES:
I Do models the metacognitive process of property selection. Thinking aloud about WHY you choose a particular property is the key teaching move.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who recognise which property before you name it
- Students who are still unclear on the differences between properties

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Harder one. Is this true or false? 4 x 15 = 12 x 5
- I could evaluate both sides: 4 x 15 = 60, 12 x 5 = 60. TRUE.
- But I can also PROVE it with properties:
- 4 x 15 = 4 x (3 x 5) = (4 x 3) x 5 = 12 x 5
- I used the associative property to show they are equivalent.
- Knowing the properties lets you prove equivalence without calculating both sides.

DO:
- Show both approaches: evaluate-and-compare vs property-based proof
- Highlight that properties give you a deeper understanding

TEACHER NOTES:
Moving from evaluation to proof is a significant conceptual step. Students who can prove equivalence using properties have genuine algebraic understanding, not just arithmetic skill.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who prefer the evaluate approach -- that is fine, but nudge toward property reasoning
- Students who attempt the property proof -- celebrate this

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. Which property would you use?
- 9 x 7 = 7 x 9. Name the property. Whisper it to your partner.

DO:
- Partners whisper, then you cold call
- Listen for: commutative

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Think-Pair-Share
Script:
- Say: "9 x 7 = 7 x 9. Which property? Whisper to your partner... now [Name], which property?"
- Scan for: commutative (swap the order).
PROCEED: If student answers correctly, move on.
PIVOT: If student says associative or distributive, reteach: "Look at what changed. The order swapped: 9 x 7 became 7 x 9. Same numbers, different order. That is commutative. Associative would be regrouping three or more factors."

TEACHER NOTES:
Quick identification check -- can students name properties by sight?

WATCH FOR:
- Students who confuse commutative and associative -- the distinction matters

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- Mixed challenge with your partner
- For each problem: solve it AND name the property you used
- Some are unknowns, some are true/false checks

DO:
- Display problems
- Partners work on whiteboards
- 3 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do mixes problem types -- unknown-finding, equivalence checking, and property identification. This is the consolidation challenge.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 5 Enabling Scaffold with a property reference card. The card lists all three properties with examples. Students match each problem to the correct property before solving.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 5 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Multi-step equation investigation. Find the value of ? in chains like: 3 x 4 = ? x 2, then use that ? to solve ? x 5 = ?? x 10. Build a three-step chain.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 5 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who can solve but struggle to name the property -- property vocabulary needs reinforcement
- Readiness signal: completing all four with correct property names

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's check.
- 1: 5 x 12 = ? x 6. Left=60, ?x6=60, ?=10. Associative: 5x(2x6)=(5x2)x6=10x6.
- 2: TRUE or FALSE: 3 x 16 = 6 x 8. Left=48, Right=48. TRUE. Associative: 3x(2x8)=(3x2)x8=6x8.
- 3: 8 x ? = 56. ?=7. (Factor knowledge.)
- 4: Use distributive to calculate 6 x 23. 6x(20+3)=120+18=138.

DO:
- Reveal, cold call, discuss properties

TEACHER NOTES:
Problem 2 shows that what looks like a simple true/false check can be explained through associative reasoning. Problem 4 applies distributive as a calculation tool.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who found alternative property explanations -- validate these

[Stage 3: We Do Answers | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge check. Finger vote.
- Which property is used here? 4 x 13 = 4 x 10 + 4 x 3
- 1 = commutative, 2 = associative, 3 = distributive

DO:
- Students vote with fingers
- Scan for 3 (distributive)

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Finger Voting
Script:
- Say: "1=commutative, 2=associative, 3=distributive. Which property: 4 x 13 = 4 x 10 + 4 x 3? Show me."
- Scan for: 3 fingers (distributive -- the multiplication is distributed across the addition).
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 3 fingers, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students show 2 (associative) because they see the number being split. Reteach: "Associative is regrouping factors: (a x b) x c. Distributive is splitting across addition: a x (b+c) = a x b + a x c. Here 13 was split into 10+3, and the 4 was multiplied by EACH part. That is distributive."

TEACHER NOTES:
The distinction between associative and distributive is the key conceptual hurdle. This hinge tests it directly.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who confuse associative and distributive -- this is the most common error at this stage

[Stage 3: CFU Hinge | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_YOUDO = `SAY:
- Independent mixed practice
- Your worksheet covers all three properties and unknown-finding
- First: Read each problem. Next: Choose your property/strategy. Then: Solve and name the property.
- 8 minutes.

DO:
- Distribute Session 5 Worksheet
- Circulate, support as needed

TEACHER NOTES:
You Do is a mixed assessment of all Week 1 skills. It uses different content from We Do.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the property reference card. Match problems to properties first, then solve.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 5 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Multi-step equation chains.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 5 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who solve correctly but cannot name properties -- vocabulary gap
- Readiness signal: completing the mixed section with confidence

[Stage 4: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EXIT = `SAY:
- Exit ticket. Three questions. 3 minutes.

DO:
- Display questions, students work alone, collect

TEACHER NOTES:
Exit ticket assesses all three SC across property identification, application, and unknown-finding.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who master everything -- ready for Week 2
- Students who struggle -- plan targeted support before Session 6

[Stage 5: Exit Ticket | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- Week 1 wrap-up! Look at our success criteria.
- SC1: I can identify which property makes an equation true. Thumbs?
- SC2: I can find unknowns using evaluate-target-solve. Thumbs?
- SC3: I can justify my answer using a named property. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: Which property do you find most useful? Why?

DO:
- Thumbs for each SC
- Turn and Talk
- Cold call 2-3 students
- Preview: "Next week we add brackets and order of operations!"

TEACHER NOTES:
End of Week 1 consolidation. The Turn and Talk targets metacognitive reflection on property utility. Preview of Week 2 builds anticipation.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who name distributive as most useful -- it has the strongest practical application
- Overall confidence level across the class

[General: Closing | VTLM 2.0: Review and Reflect]`;
