const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Session 9. Nearly there!
- Today is a different challenge. Instead of finding ONE unknown, you find PAIRS of numbers that work
- Some equations have many solutions, not just one

DO:
- Display title slide

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 9 of 10. This lesson directly addresses the curriculum elaboration: "finding pairs of unknown values in numerical equations that make the equation hold true; for example, listing possible combinations of natural numbers that make this statement true: 6 + 4 x 8 = 6 x triangle + square."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are surprised that equations can have multiple solutions

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Daily review -- patterns
- Find the rule and missing number

DO:
- Display problems, 90 seconds

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check your answers

DO:
- Reveal, self-check

TEACHER NOTES:
Tick-and-fix.

WATCH FOR:
- Confidence level

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency -- solve these equations quickly

DO:
- Display 8 single-unknown equations, 2 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
Fluency with single unknowns prepares for the step up to pairs.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who solve automatically

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention
- Read from slide: "We are learning to find pairs of unknown values that make equations true"
- Sometimes an equation has TWO unknowns. There is not just one answer -- there are MANY pairs that work.
- Read our success criteria

DO:
- Choral read

TEACHER NOTES:
The shift from single to paired unknowns is significant. Students must understand that with two unknowns and one equation, there are multiple valid solutions (infinitely many in general, but we restrict to natural numbers).

WATCH FOR:
- Students who expect exactly one answer -- the mindset shift is important

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Watch me. Here is the equation: 6 + 4 x 8 = 6 x triangle + square
- First, work out the left side: 6 + 4 x 8 = 6 + 32 = 38
- So we need: 6 x triangle + square = 38
- Now, what pairs of natural numbers (triangle, square) work?
- If triangle = 1: 6 x 1 + square = 38, square = 32. Pair: (1, 32)
- If triangle = 2: 6 x 2 + square = 38, square = 26. Pair: (2, 26)
- If triangle = 3: 6 x 3 + square = 38, square = 20. Pair: (3, 20)
- If triangle = 5: 6 x 5 + square = 38, square = 8. Pair: (5, 8)
- If triangle = 6: 6 x 6 + square = 38, square = 2. Pair: (6, 2)
- Multiple solutions! I find them by trying different values of triangle systematically.

DO:
- Write the systematic table approach
- Show how fixing one unknown lets you calculate the other
- Emphasise "systematic" -- try triangle = 1, 2, 3, etc.

TEACHER NOTES:
The systematic table approach (fix one variable, calculate the other) is the core strategy. This directly matches the curriculum elaboration.

MISCONCEPTIONS:
- Misconception: There is only one correct answer
  Why: All prior equation work had unique solutions
  Impact: Students stop after finding one pair and think they are done
  Quick correction: "This equation has MANY solutions. Your job is to find as many as you can. Keep going with the next value of triangle."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who find one pair and stop
- Students who see the systematic pattern (triangle goes up by 1, square goes down by 6)

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Let me try a simpler one first. triangle + square = 10 (natural numbers only)
- triangle = 1, square = 9. triangle = 2, square = 8. ... triangle = 9, square = 1.
- That is 9 pairs!
- Now with multiplication: triangle x square = 24
- Factor pairs of 24: 1x24, 2x12, 3x8, 4x6, 6x4, 8x3, 12x2, 24x1
- So there are 8 pairs.
- Notice: for addition equations, there are MANY pairs. For multiplication, the pairs are the factor pairs of the product.

DO:
- Show both examples
- Draw the table for each
- Connect factor pairs to multiplication equations

TEACHER NOTES:
Two types of paired-unknown equations: additive (many solutions) and multiplicative (solutions are factor pairs). Students should recognise which type they are working with.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who connect factor pairs from Session 4 to this work
- Students who see the pattern in additive equations

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. Find THREE pairs of natural numbers for: triangle + square = 12
- Write them on your whiteboard. 20 seconds.

DO:
- Students write
- Scan for three valid pairs (e.g., 1+11, 2+10, 3+9...)

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Show Me Boards
Script:
- Say: "triangle + square = 12. Write THREE pairs. Show me."
- Scan for: any three valid pairs from (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), ..., (11,1).
PROCEED: If 80%+ show three valid pairs, continue.
PIVOT: Students write only one pair or invalid pairs. Reteach: "Be systematic. Start with triangle = 1: what does square have to be? [11]. Now triangle = 2: square = ? [10]. Keep going!"

TEACHER NOTES:
Tests the systematic approach and the understanding that multiple solutions exist.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who find exactly three and stop vs those who want to find all
- Students who give duplicate pairs (1+11 and 11+1 -- discuss: are these different?)

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- With your partner, find as many pairs as you can for each equation
- Be systematic! Use a table.

DO:
- Display two equations
- Partners work together, 3 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do has one additive and one multiplicative equation. Students should recognise the different structure.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use Session 9 Enabling Scaffold with pre-drawn tables. Column 1 has triangle values pre-filled (1, 2, 3, ...). Students calculate the corresponding square value for each row.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 9 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Investigate equations with constraints. In triangle x 3 + square = 20, find all natural number pairs. Then add the constraint "triangle must be even" -- how does that change the solution set?
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 9 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who use systematic tables vs random guessing
- Readiness signal: finding all pairs for both equations

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's share. 2 x triangle + square = 20.
- triangle=1: square=18. triangle=2: square=16. ...triangle=9: square=2.
- How many pairs? [9 pairs where both are natural numbers]
- triangle x square = 36.
- Factor pairs: 1x36, 2x18, 3x12, 4x9, 6x6, 9x4, 12x3, 18x2, 36x1.

DO:
- Reveal, cold call
- Discuss: how did you know when to stop?

TEACHER NOTES:
For the additive equation, stop when square would be 0 or negative. For multiplicative, stop when you have found all factor pairs.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who found all pairs for both

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge. triangle x square = 20. How many pairs of natural numbers are there?
- 1 finger: 4 pairs    2 fingers: 6 pairs    3 fingers: 8 pairs

DO:
- Students vote

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Finger Voting
Script:
- Say: "triangle x square = 20. How many natural number pairs? 1=4, 2=6, 3=8."
- Scan for: 2 fingers (6 pairs: 1x20, 2x10, 4x5, 5x4, 10x2, 20x1).
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 2 fingers, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Students show 1 finger (4 pairs -- they only counted 1x20, 2x10, 4x5 and missed the reverses). Reteach: "Remember, 4x5 and 5x4 are different pairs because triangle and square are different positions. triangle=4, square=5 is different from triangle=5, square=4."

TEACHER NOTES:
Whether order matters depends on interpretation. In this unit, (4,5) and (5,4) are distinct because triangle and square are different unknowns.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who debate whether order matters -- great mathematical discussion

- SC3: I can explain why some equations have many solutions. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: What is the difference between finding ONE unknown and finding PAIRS?

DO:
- Thumbs, Turn and Talk, cold call
