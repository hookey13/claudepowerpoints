// ─── Teacher Notes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Session 3 of our algebra unit
- So far we have the commutative and associative properties in our toolkit
- Today we add a third: the distributive property -- this one is a game changer for mental maths

DO:
- Display title slide
- Have whiteboards ready

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 3 of 10. The distributive property (a x (b + c) = a x b + a x c) is the most practically useful property for students. It underpins mental multiplication strategies and is essential for algebraic manipulation in secondary school.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who remember commutative and associative from Session 2 -- build on this foundation

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Daily review. Today we are working with factors and multiples
- Find all the factor pairs for each number
- Write them on your whiteboard

DO:
- Display the problems
- Allow 2 minutes, circulate
- Watch for systematic listing vs random guessing

TEACHER NOTES:
Daily Review focuses on factors and multiples, which directly supports today's distributive property work. Students who can identify factors fluently will find splitting numbers easier.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who list factors randomly rather than systematically (1 x n, 2 x ?, 3 x ?, etc.)
- Students who miss factor pairs -- they may not be checking systematically

[Stage 1: Daily Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check your factor pairs -- tick the ones you found, add any you missed
- Ask: How many factor pairs does 24 have? [4 pairs: 1x24, 2x12, 3x8, 4x6]
- Numbers with lots of factor pairs are very useful in maths

DO:
- Reveal answers
- Students self-check
- Highlight that knowing factors helps with the distributive property

TEACHER NOTES:
Connecting factor fluency to today's distributive property work. Students who know factors well will find it easier to split numbers strategically.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who found all pairs for 24 and 36 -- strong factor knowledge
- Students who missed several pairs -- factor fluency needs continued work

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency time -- mixed facts, multiplication and division
- Write each answer as fast as you can
- Go!

DO:
- Display 10 mixed facts
- Time 2 minutes
- Self-check against answers

TEACHER NOTES:
Mixed multiplication and division fluency. Both operations feature in distributive property work. Students need fast recall to focus on the property rather than calculation.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are fast on multiplication but slow on division -- division may be the bottleneck
- Students who are automatic on both -- fluency is strong

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention with me
- Read from slide: "We are learning to use the distributive property to break apart multiplication into easier parts"
- Distributive means you can distribute -- or spread -- the multiplication across an addition
- Read our success criteria together

DO:
- Choral read LI and SC
- Quick example: "What is 4 x 13? Hard to do in your head. But what if I told you there is a trick to make it easy?"

TEACHER NOTES:
The hook is practical: the distributive property makes hard multiplication easy. Students will see that 4 x 13 = 4 x 10 + 4 x 3 = 40 + 12 = 52 -- much easier than trying to multiply 4 x 13 directly. This motivates the property.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who already use this mental strategy intuitively -- name it: "You are already using the distributive property!"

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Watch me. I want to work out 4 x 13
- 13 is not a nice number to multiply. But I can split it into 10 + 3
- So 4 x 13 = 4 x (10 + 3)
- Now I distribute the 4 across both parts: 4 x 10 + 4 x 3
- 4 x 10 = 40. 4 x 3 = 12. Add them: 40 + 12 = 52
- I just turned a hard problem into two easy ones!
- Look at the area model on screen. The rectangle is 4 by 13. I split the 13 into 10 and 3. Two smaller rectangles. Same total area.

DO:
- Write each step clearly
- Point to the area model as you explain
- Emphasise: "splitting the number, then multiplying each part"

TEACHER NOTES:
The area model makes the distributive property visual: a 4 x 13 rectangle splits into 4 x 10 and 4 x 3 rectangles. The total area stays the same. This is the key visual anchor.

MISCONCEPTIONS:
- Misconception: You can only split the second number, not the first
  Why: All examples shown in this format (a x (b + c)) suggest the first number stays whole
  Impact: Minor -- either number can be split, but splitting the larger or more awkward number is strategically better
  Quick correction: "You could split either number. 4 x 13 = (2 + 2) x 13 = 2 x 13 + 2 x 13 works too. But splitting 13 into 10 + 3 gives easier parts."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who recognise this as a mental maths strategy they already use
- Students who struggle with the area model -- they may need to see it physically with grid paper

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Another example. 7 x 15.
- I will split 15 into 10 + 5
- 7 x 15 = 7 x (10 + 5) = 7 x 10 + 7 x 5 = 70 + 35 = 105
- Now let me try a different split: 15 = 8 + 7
- 7 x 15 = 7 x (8 + 7) = 7 x 8 + 7 x 7 = 56 + 49 = 105
- Same answer! You can split any way you like -- the distributive property always works
- But notice: splitting into 10 + 5 was easier. Choose your split wisely!

DO:
- Show both splits side by side
- Circle the fact that both give 105
- Emphasise the strategic choice of split

TEACHER NOTES:
Showing two different valid splits for the same problem demonstrates that the property is flexible. But the pedagogical message is clear: split strategically (usually around 10s) for the easiest calculation. This builds number sense alongside algebraic understanding.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who see that splitting by 10 is strategically better -- good number sense
- Students who want to try their own splits -- encourage this exploration

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. On your whiteboards, use the distributive property to work out 6 x 14
- Split 14 into parts. Show your working. 15 seconds.

DO:
- Students write on whiteboards
- Scan for: 6 x (10 + 4) = 60 + 24 = 84

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Show Me Boards
Script:
- Say: "Use the distributive property. Split 14 into easier parts. Show me 6 x 14 with your working."
- Scan for: 84, with working showing 6 x 10 + 6 x 4.
PROCEED: If 80%+ show correct working with 84, move to We Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students split 14 into 1 and 4 (treating digits separately) giving 6 x 1 + 6 x 4 = 6 + 24 = 30. Reteach: "14 is not 1 and 4. It is 10 and 4. The 1 in 14 represents 10. So we split 14 into 10 + 4, not 1 + 4."

TEACHER NOTES:
First CFU tests the core skill: splitting a two-digit number and distributing. The place-value error (splitting digits instead of values) is the most common misconception.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who split 14 into 7 + 7 instead of 10 + 4 -- valid but less efficient
- Students who get 84 but cannot show the distributive steps

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- With your partner, use the distributive property for each problem
- Split the number, multiply each part, add the results
- Show all your working

DO:
- Display four problems
- Partners work on whiteboards
- Circulate and listen for strategic splitting
- Allow 2 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do problems increase in complexity. Problems 1-2 have obvious 10-based splits. Problems 3-4 require more strategic thinking about how to split.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 3 Enabling Scaffold with pre-drawn area model grids. Each grid shows the total rectangle already split into two parts. Students count the squares in each part and write the distributive equation.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 3 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the distributive property as a mental maths power tool. Calculate 8 x 25, 12 x 15, 7 x 99, and 6 x 48 using the distributive property. Then create your own "impossible-looking" multiplication that becomes easy with the right split.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 3 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who always split at 10 -- valid, but encourage flexibility
- Readiness signal: partners explaining their split choice to each other

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's check. 3 x 16: split 16 into 10 + 6. 3 x 10 = 30, 3 x 6 = 18. 30 + 18 = 48.
- 5 x 23: split 23 into 20 + 3. 5 x 20 = 100, 5 x 3 = 15. 100 + 15 = 115.
- 8 x 12: split 12 into 10 + 2. 8 x 10 = 80, 8 x 2 = 16. 80 + 16 = 96.
- 4 x 17: split 17 into 10 + 7. 4 x 10 = 40, 4 x 7 = 28. 40 + 28 = 68.

DO:
- Reveal one at a time
- Cold call for each
- Ask: "Did anyone use a different split?" Validate alternatives

TEACHER NOTES:
Validating alternative splits reinforces that the property works regardless of how you split. The strategic choice is about ease of calculation, not correctness.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who found alternative splits and got the same answer -- celebrate this
- Students who made arithmetic errors in the partial products -- the strategy is correct, the calculation needs practice

[Stage 3: We Do Answers | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge check. Finger vote.
- Which split is BEST for 9 x 18?
- 1 finger: 9 x (10 + 8)
- 2 fingers: 9 x (9 + 9)
- 3 fingers: 9 x (20 - 2)

DO:
- Students show fingers
- All three are valid! But scan for reasoning
- Follow up: "They all work. Which gives the easiest calculation?"

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Finger Voting
Script:
- Say: "Three possible splits for 9 x 18. Which is BEST? 1 = split into 10+8, 2 = split into 9+9, 3 = split into 20-2. Show me."
- Scan for: Accept any (all valid). 1 finger (10+8) gives 90+72=162. 3 fingers (20-2) gives 180-18=162 (subtraction variant). All correct.
PROCEED: If 80%+ select a valid option and can justify, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students think only one split is "correct." Reteach: "All three splits work -- watch: 9x10+9x8=90+72=162. 9x9+9x9=81+81=162. 9x20-9x2=180-18=162. The distributive property does not care how you split -- it always gives the same answer."

TEACHER NOTES:
This hinge introduces the subtraction variant (9 x (20-2)) which previews compensation strategies. All options are valid -- the pedagogical point is strategic flexibility.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who only picked one option -- they may not yet see that multiple splits work
- Students who chose option 3 -- they may have strong number sense

[Stage 3: CFU Hinge | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_YOUDO = `SAY:
- Independent practice
- Your worksheet has problems where you use the distributive property
- First: Choose your split. Next: Multiply each part. Then: Add the results.
- Show all working. 8 minutes.

DO:
- Distribute Session 3 Worksheet
- Students work independently
- Circulate: support students with area model scaffold if needed
- Distribute enabling/extending resources as appropriate

TEACHER NOTES:
You Do uses different numbers from We Do. Section B requires students to identify the distributive property in given equations and Section C asks students to write their own distributive splits.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the pre-drawn area model grids. Count squares to find each partial product, then add.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 3 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Mental maths power tool investigation. Use distributive property for challenging multiplications and create "impossible-looking" problems.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 3 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who can split and calculate but do not show distributive notation -- redirect to write a x (b + c) = a x b + a x c
- Readiness signal: 80%+ completing Section A correctly within 5 minutes

[Stage 4: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EXIT = `SAY:
- Exit ticket. Three questions. 3 minutes. Work alone.

DO:
- Display questions
- Students work silently
- Collect to sort

TEACHER NOTES:
Q1 tests basic application (SC1). Q2 tests recognising the property in an equation (SC2). Q3 tests writing a distributive equation for a given area model (SC3).

WATCH FOR:
- Students who calculate correctly but do not show distributive steps
- Students who get all three instantly -- ready for unknown-finding in Session 4

[Stage 5: Exit Ticket | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- Success criteria check.
- SC1: I can split a number and use the distributive property to multiply. Thumbs?
- SC2: I can explain why the distributive property works using an area model. Thumbs?
- SC3: I can choose the best split for a given multiplication. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: How would you use the distributive property to work out 7 x 99? Tell your partner.

DO:
- Run thumbs for each SC
- 30 seconds Turn and Talk
- Cold call -- listen for 7 x (100-1) = 700-7 = 693

TEACHER NOTES:
The 7 x 99 prompt naturally leads to the subtraction variant (split as 100-1). Students who see this have strong number sense and algebraic flexibility.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who try 7 x (90+9) -- valid but harder. Guide toward 100-1
- Students who use the property confidently -- ready for Session 4

[General: Closing | VTLM 2.0: Review and Reflect]`;

const NOTES_RESOURCES = `SAY:
- Resources for today are linked here

DO:
- Point out each resource

TEACHER NOTES:
Resource slide with clickable links to companion PDFs.
