const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Session 10 -- our final session for this week. No new chapters today. This is a dedicated writing session
- Today you are writing the first body paragraph of your information report using your SPO plan from last session
- Have your SPO template ready on your desk

DO:
- Display title slide as students settle
- Check every student has their SPO from Session 9. Have blank spares for students who forgot
- Have the non-fiction article available for students who want to add to their plans

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 10 of 10. This is a writing-focused session with no new novel content. Students convert their SPO plan into a full body paragraph, then proofread and edit using a checklist. The mentor paragraph models the language features expected.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who do not have their SPO -- provide a spare template and give 5 minutes to plan before writing
- Students who are ready to write immediately -- let them start while others catch up

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose and Relevance]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention from the slide
- Today is about writing and polishing. We go from plan to paragraph
- Read the success criteria. SC1 is about writing the paragraph with the right structure. SC2 is about using the language features of an information report. SC3 is about editing your own work

DO:
- Choral read the LI, then the SCs
- Brief check: "Who has their SPO ready? Hold it up" [scan]

TEACHER NOTES:
SC1 targets the structural output (TS + supporting details + CS). SC2 targets language features (present tense, third person, noun groups, appositives, relative clauses). SC3 targets the editing/proofreading skill.

WATCH FOR:
- Students confident and ready to write -- they can begin during the revision slide
- Students without a plan -- they need planning time before writing

[General: Learning Intention | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_REVISION = `SAY:
- Quick revision. The purpose of a body paragraph in an information report is to classify or describe one aspect of your topic
- Structure: topic sentence, supporting detail sentences, concluding sentence
- Language features we have been learning this unit that you can use: appositives from Session 6, relative clauses from Session 7
- Other features: present tense, third person pronouns, adjectives for description, subheadings, technical vocabulary
- You do not need to use EVERY feature in one paragraph. But aim to include at least an appositive or a relative clause to show what you have learned

DO:
- Display the structure and features overview
- Point to the mentor text body paragraph -- show where specific features appear
- Keep this brief: 3 minutes maximum. Students are eager to write

TEACHER NOTES:
The revision connects the sentence-level skills from Sessions 6 and 7 to the text-level writing. Students should see that appositives and relative clauses are tools for enriching their information report writing, not isolated grammar exercises.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who do not see the connection between sentence-level and text-level work -- make it explicit: "Remember our appositives? You can use them in your information report to add detail"
- Students who feel overwhelmed by the feature list -- reassure: "Focus on writing a clear paragraph first. Then look for places to add features"

[General: Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_IDO_WRITE = `SAY:
- Watch me turn my SPO into a written paragraph
- I start with my topic sentence. I wrote: "Life in 18th century England was shaped by the dramatic changes of the Industrial Revolution"
- Now I expand my first detail: "Factories, which replaced traditional craftsmen, transformed the way people worked." See that? I used a relative clause: "which replaced traditional craftsmen"
- Second detail: "Cities grew rapidly as workers, many of them former farm labourers, moved to find employment in the new industries." I used an appositive: "many of them former farm labourers"
- Third detail: "Living conditions in these rapidly growing cities were often poor, with overcrowding, pollution and disease becoming widespread"
- Concluding sentence: "These dramatic changes transformed English society, creating both new opportunities and significant hardship for ordinary people"
- Notice: my paragraph follows the SPO plan exactly. The plan is the skeleton. The writing is the flesh

DO:
- Display the model paragraph being built step by step
- Highlight the appositive and relative clause as they are added
- Think aloud: "I check -- does each sentence connect to the one before it? Yes. That is cohesion"
- Display the full finished paragraph

TEACHER NOTES:
The I Do explicitly demonstrates converting an SPO into a paragraph. The key modelling moves: expanding notes into full sentences, weaving in language features (appositive, relative clause), checking cohesion between sentences.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are mentally drafting already -- good: they are engaged
- Students who look confused about the expansion process -- the mentor PDF provides another model

[General: I Do -- Modelling | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Teaching / Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU = `SAY:
- Quick check before you write. I am going to show you two sentences. Which one uses a language feature of an information report more effectively?
- Sentence A: "People worked in factories. The factories were big"
- Sentence B: "Workers, many of them children as young as five, laboured in factories that dominated the city skyline"
- Thumbs up for A, thumbs down for B
- Three, two, one -- show! [Scan]

DO:
- Use Thumbs Up/Down
- Scan for: thumbs down (B is more effective)
- Brief discussion: "What makes B better?" [More detail, an appositive, a relative clause, precise vocabulary, one sentence instead of two]

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Thumbs Up/Down

Script:
- "Which sentence is more effective for an information report? Thumbs up = A, thumbs down = B"
- Scan for: mostly thumbs down
- Follow up: "Name ONE feature that makes B better" [Cold Call 2-3 students]

PROCEED (>=80%): Most show thumbs down and can name a feature. Release to write.
PIVOT (<80%): Most likely issue -- students choose A because it is simpler and they think "clear = good." Reteach: "Clear writing is important. But Sentence A gives almost no information. Sentence B tells us WHO worked (children as young as five), WHAT the factories were like (dominated the skyline), and does it in one sentence. An information report needs to INFORM -- B does that, A does not." Re-check: "Which sentence teaches the reader more about 18th century England?"

TEACHER NOTES:
This CFU checks that students understand what effective information report writing looks like before they begin their own paragraph. The comparison directly targets SC2 (language features).

WATCH FOR:
- Students who choose A "because it is easier to read" -- redirect: the goal is to inform, not just be simple
- Students who can name features in B -- they are ready to write

[General: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Formative Assessment]`;

const NOTES_WRITE = `SAY:
- Time to write. Open your SPO template from last session. You are turning your plan into a full body paragraph
- First: write your topic sentence
- Next: expand each supporting detail into a full sentence. Try to include at least one appositive or relative clause
- Then: write your concluding sentence
- You have 15 minutes to draft. Then we will edit
- If you need to update your SPO with new information from the article, do that first

DO:
- Release students to write
- Circulate actively -- this is the key conferencing time
- Priority checks: Is the structure correct (TS + details + CS)? Are details from the article? Is there at least one appositive or relative clause attempt?
- Confer with enabling students first, then extending students

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Provide the topic sentence written out in full. Students write 2 supporting detail sentences using their SPO notes, then a concluding sentence. Sentence starters provided: "One major change was...", "As a result of this,...", "In conclusion,..."
- Extra Notes: These students can refer to the mentor paragraph for structural guidance

EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: After completing the first body paragraph, draft a SECOND body paragraph on a different aspect of 18th century England (e.g., education, social class, child labour). Write independently with their own topic sentence, supporting details, and concluding sentence. Must include at least one appositive AND one relative clause

TEACHER NOTES:
The 15-minute writing block is the core of this session. Circulate and confer -- this is formative assessment in real time. Students who finish early should proofread using the editing checklist before starting the extending task.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who write their SPO notes as the paragraph (no expansion) -- remind: "Your SPO is the plan. Now write full sentences"
- Students who forget the concluding sentence -- remind: "Your paragraph needs an ending. How do you wrap up?"
- Students who include language features naturally -- celebrate: "You used a relative clause there. Well done"

[General: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EDIT = `SAY:
- Writing time is up. Now we edit
- Use the editing checklist on your worksheet. Read through your paragraph and check each item
- Read your paragraph aloud quietly to yourself. Does it sound right? Does it flow?
- Check spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Especially check your commas around appositives and relative clauses
- You have 5 minutes to edit. Then swap with a partner for peer feedback

DO:
- Distribute the Session 10 Editing Checklist (if not already distributed)
- Students read and self-edit using the checklist
- After 3 minutes: "Swap paragraphs with your partner. Read theirs and give ONE piece of positive feedback and ONE suggestion"
- After 5 minutes total: "Make any final changes based on your partner's feedback"

TEACHER NOTES:
The edit phase is non-negotiable -- students must read and revise their own work before it is considered complete. The peer swap adds a second pair of eyes and builds collaborative editing habits.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who say "it is fine" without reading -- insist: "Read it aloud. Your ear catches what your eye misses"
- Students who give vague peer feedback ("good job") -- model specific feedback: "Your topic sentence clearly introduces the topic. Can you add an appositive to sentence 3?"

[General: You Do -- Edit | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress and Feedback]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- Success criteria check. SC1: writing a body paragraph with TS, supporting details, and CS -- thumbs? [scan]
- SC2: using at least one language feature of an information report -- thumbs? [scan]
- SC3: proofreading and editing your paragraph -- thumbs? [scan]
- Quick write: on a sticky note or the back of your checklist, write one thing you are proud of in your paragraph and one thing you want to improve next time

DO:
- Run through each SC with thumbs check
- The quick write is a self-assessment tool -- collect for teacher review
- Wrap up the week: "That is our final session for Week 2. You have read 11 chapters, learned appositives, relative clauses, KPAS note-taking, and started your information report. Well done"

TEACHER NOTES:
The closing wraps up the entire week. Collecting the quick-write sticky notes provides diagnostic data for planning Week 3. Students who are "thumbs down" on SC2 may need additional sentence-level modelling in the next week.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are proud of their work -- celebrate publicly
- Students who identify specific improvements -- this metacognition is valuable
- Collect all body paragraphs for teacher assessment and feedback before Session 11

[General: Closing | VTLM 2.0: Review and Reflect]`;

const NOTES_RESOURCES = `SAY:
- Two resources today
- The ${CHECKLIST_RESOURCE.name} is for proofreading and editing your body paragraph
- The ${MENTOR_RESOURCE.name} is a model paragraph showing the language features of an information report

DO:
- Print the editing checklist (one per student)
- Print the mentor paragraph (one per student or display on screen)
- Both are used during the lesson, not as take-home resources

TEACHER NOTES:
The editing checklist is used during the edit phase. The mentor paragraph can be displayed during I Do or given to students as a reference during writing.
