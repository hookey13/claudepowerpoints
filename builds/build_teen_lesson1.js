// ─── Teacher Notes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Welcome back! We have been on holidays and now we are ready to learn
- This week we are going to learn about teen numbers
- Teen numbers are the numbers from 11 to 20

DO:
- Display title slide as students settle on the mat
- Have counters and ten frames ready

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 1 of 5. First lesson back from holidays -- keep the pace gentle and achievable. This session introduces teen numbers 11-15 only, building the concept that teen means "ten and some more."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who seem unsettled after the break -- use a calm, welcoming tone to re-establish routines

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Let's warm up our counting brains
- I want you to count from 1 to 20 with me
- Then try the counting challenges on your own

DO:
- Lead a choral count 1-20 first (whole class together)
- Then display the challenges
- Students show answers on whiteboards or fingers

TEACHER NOTES:
Daily Review retrieves counting fluency from Term 1. After a 16-day break, some students may be rusty. The choral count rebuilds confidence before individual challenges.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who hesitate or lose track after 12 or 13 -- teen numbers are the common stumbling point
- Students who count fluently to 20 -- counting automaticity is intact

[Stage 1: Daily Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check your answers -- tick if you got it right, fix it if you did not
- Fixing it is the learning
- Ask: What number comes after 13? [14]

DO:
- Click to reveal answers
- Students tick correct responses and fix errors
- Scan for students who struggled with the teen numbers specifically

TEACHER NOTES:
Tick-and-fix gives immediate feedback on counting recall. Note which students hesitate in the 11-19 range -- this unit targets exactly that gap.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who got all answers correct quickly -- counting to 20 is secure
- Students who made errors in the teen range (11-19) -- they are the target learners for this unit

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency time -- let's get our counting muscles warmed up
- We are going to count together from 1 to 20
- Clap on every number. Ready? 1, 2, 3...
- Now let's try counting from 1 to 20 but WHISPER the numbers 1 to 10 and SHOUT the numbers 11 to 20

DO:
- Lead clap-and-count 1-20 (whole class, together)
- Then whisper/shout activity to highlight the teen numbers
- Repeat 2-3 times, getting faster each time

TEACHER NOTES:
Fluency builds counting automaticity. The whisper/shout activity draws attention to the shift at 11 -- priming students for the lesson focus on teen numbers. This is about rhythm and confidence, not new teaching.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who cannot keep the clapping rhythm -- they may need counting support
- Students who shout with confidence from 11-20 -- counting is automated

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention with me
- Read from slide: "We are learning to name and recognise the teen numbers 11 to 15"
- Now our success criteria. Read each one.
- Ask: Has anyone heard the word "teen" before? What do you think it means?

DO:
- Choral read the LI then each SC
- Accept student ideas about what "teen" means
- Do not correct yet -- the I Do will build the understanding

TEACHER NOTES:
This is the gateway to the teen numbers unit. The word "teen" signals "ten and more." SC1 is the floor -- every student should be able to say the numbers. SC2 is the core target. SC3 extends to conceptual understanding of place value at Foundation level.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who already know what teen means -- prior knowledge is present
- Students who look blank -- they are meeting this concept for the first time, and that is okay

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Watch me. I am going to show you what teen numbers are
- Teen numbers are numbers that have a TEN and some more
- Look at this ten frame. It is full -- that is 10
- Now I add one more counter. 10 and 1 more makes... 11. Eleven.
- 11 is a teen number. It means ten and one more
- Now watch. I add another counter. 10 and 2 more makes... 12. Twelve.

DO:
- Point to the ten frame visual on screen
- Physically demonstrate with real counters if possible
- Say each number name slowly and clearly
- Emphasise "ten and ___ more" for each number

TEACHER NOTES:
This I Do establishes the core concept: teen = ten + extra ones. The ten frame makes this visible and concrete. Foundation students need the physical/visual anchor before the abstract number name. Keep the pace slow and repeat the pattern "ten and ___ more" for each number.

MISCONCEPTIONS:
- Misconception: Students think 11 and 12 are completely separate from 10
  Why: The words "eleven" and "twelve" do not sound like "ten-one" or "ten-two" the way thirteen sounds like "three-teen"
  Impact: Students cannot see the ten-and-ones structure in these numbers, which blocks place value understanding
  Quick correction: "Eleven means ten and one more. I can show you -- look, a full ten frame and one extra."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who look at the ten frame and can see it is "full" plus extras -- the visual anchor is working
- Students who seem confused by the connection between the full frame and the number name

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Let's keep going. Watch me build 13, 14, and 15
- 10 and 3 more makes... 13. Thirteen. Can you hear "three" in "thirteen"?
- 10 and 4 more makes... 14. Fourteen. Can you hear "four" in "fourteen"?
- 10 and 5 more makes... 15. Fifteen. Can you hear "five" in "fifteen"?
- Every teen number starts with a full ten and then has extra ones

DO:
- Build each number on the ten frame visual
- Point to the "extras" for each number
- Have students repeat each number name after you
- Emphasise the pattern: teen numbers have "ten and some more"

TEACHER NOTES:
This I Do extends to 13-15, where the naming pattern becomes more transparent (thir-teen, four-teen, fif-teen). Drawing attention to the sound pattern helps students connect the name to the structure.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who start saying the numbers before you -- they are picking up the pattern
- Students who can hear "three" in "thirteen" -- phonological awareness is supporting number sense

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. I am going to show you a ten frame
- Count the counters and tell me the number
- Show me on your fingers how many extras there are after the ten

DO:
- Display a ten frame showing 13 (10 + 3)
- Students show 3 fingers for the extras
- Then cold call: "What number is this?" [13]

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Finger Voting
Script:
- Say: "Look at the ten frame. The ten frame is full -- that is 10. Now count the extras. Show me on your fingers how many extras. Ready... show me."
- Scan for: 3 fingers. Students who show 3 quickly have grasped the ten-and-ones structure.
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 3 fingers, move to the We Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students count ALL the counters from 1 instead of seeing the full ten plus extras. Reteach: "The ten frame is full. That means we already have 10. We do not need to count those again. Just count the extra ones: 1, 2, 3. So it is 10 and 3 more -- 13."

TEACHER NOTES:
This CFU checks whether students can decompose a teen number into ten + ones using the visual. Finger voting is quick and universal for Foundation.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who count from 1 instead of recognising the full ten frame -- they need more support with subitising 10
- Readiness signal: students showing 3 fingers instantly without counting the ten frame cells individually

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- Your turn! I will show you a ten frame picture
- With your partner, work out which teen number it shows
- Hold up your whiteboard with the number when you are ready

DO:
- Display ten frames for 11, 14, 12, 15 one at a time
- Partners discuss and write the number on whiteboards
- Allow 20 seconds per number
- Cold call for each answer

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do uses the same ten frame format as I Do but asks students to identify the number rather than watch the teacher build it. Working with a partner supports students who are still building confidence after the break.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 1 Enabling Scaffold which has pre-drawn ten frames with the ten already shaded. Students only need to count the extra ones and write the number.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 1 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: After identifying each number, draw your own ten frame to show a teen number your partner calls out. Then try numbers beyond 15 (16, 17).
- Extra Notes: Extending students work with the Session 1 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who write the correct number quickly -- they can read the ten frame structure
- Students who write single-digit numbers (e.g., writing 4 instead of 14) -- they are counting extras but not adding the ten

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's check. First ten frame: a full ten and 1 more. What number? [11] Eleven!
- Second: a full ten and 4 more. [14] Fourteen!
- Third: a full ten and 2 more. [12] Twelve!
- Fourth: a full ten and 5 more. [15] Fifteen!

DO:
- Reveal answers one at a time
- Cold call different students for each
- For each, repeat "ten and ___ more makes ___"

TEACHER NOTES:
Reinforcing the "ten and ___ more" language pattern with each reveal builds the connection between the visual and the number name.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who self-correct when they hear the answer -- learning is happening in the moment
- Students who got all four correct -- they are ready for independent practice

[Stage 3: We Do Answers | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge check. Thumbs up if I say the right number, thumbs down if I say the wrong number
- This ten frame shows a full ten and 3 more. Is this 13?
- Show me... now.

DO:
- Students show thumbs up (correct -- it is 13)
- Follow up: "How do you know?" Cold call 2 students
- Then try a wrong one: "This shows a full ten and 2 more. Is this 15?" [Thumbs down -- it is 12]

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Thumbs Up/Down
Script:
- Say: "Thumbs up if I am right, thumbs down if I am wrong. This ten frame has a full ten and 3 extras. Is this 13? Think... show me."
- Scan for: thumbs up. Then: "This one has a full ten and 2 extras. Is this 15?" Scan for: thumbs down.
PROCEED: If 80%+ get both correct, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Most likely misconception -- students confuse the extras count with the total. Reteach using physical counters: "Let's count together. Here is my full ten. Now my extras: 1, 2, 3. Ten and 3 more is 13, not 3."

TEACHER NOTES:
Two-part hinge checks both positive and negative identification. The wrong example is critical -- it confirms students are not just agreeing with everything.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who show thumbs up for both -- they may be agreeing rather than checking
- Readiness signal: confident thumbs down on the wrong example with quick correction to "12"

[Stage 3: CFU Hinge | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_YOUDO = `SAY:
- Independent practice time
- On your worksheet you will see ten frames
- First: Count the full ten. Next: Count the extras. Then: Write the teen number.
- You have 6 minutes. Go.

DO:
- Distribute Session 1 Worksheet
- Students work independently
- Circulate: start with students who struggled during We Do
- For enabling students, distribute the Session 1 Enabling Scaffold
- For extending students, distribute the Session 1 Extension

TEACHER NOTES:
You Do uses different ten frame arrangements from the We Do (different numbers, some with visual distractors). The worksheet progresses: identify numbers, then draw counters to match a given number.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Complete the enabling scaffold where the ten is pre-shaded. Students count only the extras and trace the number. Simpler numbers (11, 12, 13) only.
- Extra Notes: Distribute the Session 1 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Use the Session 1 Extension to explore teen numbers beyond 15. Draw ten frames for 16, 17, 18 and discover the pattern continues.
- Extra Notes: Self-contained investigation with visual examples.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who write the correct numbers quickly -- ten frame reading is secured
- Students who draw the correct number of counters when asked to "show 14" -- they can represent as well as identify
- Readiness signal: completing 6+ problems correctly within 4 minutes

[Stage 4: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EXIT = `SAY:
- Exit ticket time. Three quick questions.
- Work on your own. You have 2 minutes.

DO:
- Display the exit ticket
- Students respond on whiteboards or in workbooks
- Collect or scan responses to sort into secure, developing, beginning

TEACHER NOTES:
Exit ticket assesses SC1 (Q1 -- say the number) and SC2 (Q2 -- identify from ten frame). Q3 touches SC3 (explain the structure). Sort results to plan Session 2 support.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who get Q1 and Q2 correct but struggle with Q3 -- they can identify but not yet explain the structure
- Students who complete all three -- they are ready for numbers 16-20 in Session 2

[Stage 5: Exit Ticket | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- Let's check our success criteria. Look at the slide.
- SC1: I can say the numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Thumbs up, sideways, or down.
- SC2: I can match a teen number to its ten frame picture. Thumbs?
- SC3: I can explain that teen numbers have a ten and extra ones. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: Tell your partner what "teen" means in teen numbers.

DO:
- Display success criteria on screen
- Run thumbs check for each SC
- Allow 30 seconds for Turn and Talk
- Cold call 2-3 students to share

TEACHER NOTES:
Closing brings the lesson full circle. The Turn and Talk targets the core concept: teen = ten + more. Students who can say "it means ten and some more" have grasped the key idea.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who say "teen means ten and more" -- the concept is forming
- Students who still seem unsure -- they will get more practice in Sessions 2-5

[General: Closing | VTLM 2.0: Review and Reflect]`;

const NOTES_RESOURCES = `SAY:
- These are the resources for today's lesson
- The worksheet and answer key are linked here

DO:
- Point out each resource and its purpose

TEACHER NOTES:
Resource slide provides clickable links to all companion PDFs for this session.

WATCH FOR:
- N/A -- resource slide is teacher reference only
