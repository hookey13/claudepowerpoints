const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Session 8 today. Two chapters: 18 and 19
- Last session Tom was sentenced to seven years transportation. Today we follow his journey towards the ship
- Our writing focus is a practical skill: note-taking using key words, phrases, abbreviations and symbols

DO:
- Display title slide as students settle
- Have copies of the novel on desks, bookmarked at Chapter 18

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 8 of 10. Chapters 18-19 cover Tom's transport to Plymouth and boarding the Scarborough, plus a reflective Thomas chapter. The note-taking skill (KPAS) is a study skill that supports the information report writing in Sessions 9-10.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who need a recap of Chapter 17 -- Tom was sentenced to transportation, not hanging
- Students who are curious about where Tom is going -- Botany Bay and the First Fleet

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose and Relevance]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention from the slide
- Two strands: reading Chapters 18-19 for character development, and learning to take efficient notes
- Read the success criteria. SC1 is about character through dialogue. SC2 is about the author's use of repetition. SC3 is the note-taking skill -- converting full sentences into key words, phrases, abbreviations and symbols

DO:
- Choral read the LI, then the SCs
- Brief preview: "Note-taking is a skill you will use across all your subjects. Today we learn a system for doing it efficiently"

TEACHER NOTES:
SC1 targets the Sam/Tom relationship -- Sam's dialogue reveals hope and experience. SC2 targets the "Down, down, down" repetition. SC3 is the KPAS writing skill that bridges into the information report sessions.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who think note-taking is just copying -- the KPAS system teaches them to transform, not transcribe
- Students excited about the First Fleet connection -- channel this into Sessions 9-10

[General: Learning Intention | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_VOCAB_IMPENETRABLE = `SAY:
- First vocabulary word: impenetrable. Read it with me: impenetrable [students repeat]
- Impenetrable means impossible to pass through or see through. An impenetrable wall cannot be broken. Impenetrable darkness cannot be seen through
- In our novel, Tom descends into the ship and encounters impenetrable darkness below deck -- he literally cannot see anything
- Ask: What is the opposite of impenetrable? [Penetrable, see-through, clear, passable]

DO:
- Display word, choral read, define, give example
- Cold Call: "What else could be described as impenetrable?" [A forest, fog, armour, a fortress, silence]
- Sentence completion: "The fog was so impenetrable that ___" [we could not see our hands, the ship could not navigate, everyone was lost]

TEACHER NOTES:
"Impenetrable" is a strong descriptive word that connects to the sensory imagery in Chapter 18. Teaching both literal (physical barrier) and figurative (impenetrable silence) builds transfer.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who struggle with the word length -- break it down: im-PENE-trable. "Penetrate" means to pass through. "Im" means not. So: cannot be passed through
- Students who only think of physical barriers -- extend to abstract: "impenetrable mystery"

[General: I Do -- Vocabulary | VTLM 2.0: Building Vocabulary]`;

const NOTES_VOCAB_QUEASY = `SAY:
- Second word: queasy. Read it with me: queasy [students repeat]
- Queasy means feeling sick or nauseous, especially in your stomach. You might feel queasy on a boat, in a car, or when you see something unpleasant
- In our novel, Tom boards a ship for the first time. The rocking, the smell, the cramped conditions below deck -- it is very likely making him queasy
- Quick dramatisation: show me your face when you feel queasy [students demonstrate]
- Turn and talk: when was the last time you felt queasy? What caused it? [30 seconds]

DO:
- Display word, choral read, define, example
- Dramatisation for engagement
- Turn and Talk: 30 seconds, Cold Call 2 pairs
- Connect to the novel: "Tom has never been on a ship before. He has been underground in chimneys and now he is in the belly of a boat"

TEACHER NOTES:
"Queasy" is a sensory word that connects to the physical experience of the ship voyage. The dramatisation and personal connection make it memorable.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who confuse "queasy" with "uneasy" -- they are related (both uncomfortable) but queasy is specifically about physical nausea
- Students who have motion sickness experiences -- their personal connection to the word is strong

[General: I Do -- Vocabulary | VTLM 2.0: Building Vocabulary]`;

const NOTES_READING = `SAY:
- Chapters 18 and 19. Tom leaves prison and begins the journey to Botany Bay
- I will read Chapter 18 aloud. Chapter 19 is shorter -- a Thomas reflection chapter
- Focus: watch for two things. First, the repetition of a word at a key moment. Second, how Sam's character is revealed through what he says to Tom
- Find Chapter 18 now

DO:
- Give students 30 seconds to find the chapter
- Teacher reads aloud
- Plan for 2 pause points: p.90 and p.95

TEACHER NOTES:
Chapter 18 introduces Sailor Sam, a significant character who provides hope and mentorship. Chapter 19 reveals Thomas's life outcomes (grazier, magistrate, large family), giving students a glimpse of where Tom's story ends. The "Down, down, down" repetition in Chapter 18 is a key literary device.

WATCH FOR:
- Students fascinated by the First Fleet details -- acknowledge and connect to Sessions 9-10
- Students who notice the shift in tone when Sam appears -- excellent character awareness

[General: Reading Launch | VTLM 2.0: Structured Reading Practice]`;

const NOTES_PAUSE1 = `SAY:
- Pause here. "It was impossible to see"
- Just before this, the author wrote "Down, down, down..." as Tom descends into the ship
- Ask: Why might the author have repeated "down"? [The repetition creates a sense of descent -- Tom keeps going deeper and deeper. It feels relentless and claustrophobic. Each "down" takes him further from the light, further from freedom]
- Ask: What does this make you feel about the situation right now? [Trapped, suffocating, hopeless. Tom is being swallowed by the ship]

DO:
- Display the quote
- Read the "Down, down, down" slowly and deliberately
- Give think time, then Cold Call

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Cold Call

Script:
- "Why three 'downs' and not just one?" [Repetition creates intensity -- one "down" is a direction, three is a journey into darkness]
- "What does this remind you of from earlier in the novel?" [The chimneys -- Tom was always going down into dark, tight spaces. The ship is another version of the same experience]
- Scan for: students connecting the descent into the ship to the chimney experiences

PROCEED (>=80%): Most students understand the effect of repetition and connect to the chimney imagery. Continue reading.
PIVOT (<80%): Most likely issue -- students describe the literal meaning without the emotional effect. Reteach: "Read it aloud: 'Down, down, down.' Each word drags you further. The author is not just telling us Tom went below deck -- they are making us FEEL it. This is called the rule of threes -- repeating something three times for effect." Re-check: "What is the emotional effect?"

TEACHER NOTES:
The "Down, down, down" repetition uses the rule of threes for emotional intensity. It also creates a structural parallel with Tom's chimney experiences -- always descending into darkness.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who connect this to the chimney imagery -- excellent: pattern recognition across the novel
- Students who feel the claustrophobia of the description -- acknowledge: "The author wants you to feel that"

[General: Pause Point 1 | VTLM 2.0: Higher-Order Questioning]`;

const NOTES_PAUSE2 = `SAY:
- Pause here. "And Sam's voice was full of hope, for himself as well as Tom"
- Ask: What did we learn from this conversation between Sam and Tom? [Sam tells Tom about Botany Bay, about sailing the seas. He gives Tom something he has not had in a long time -- hope. And the author tells us Sam needs that hope too]
- Ask: How is the author making you feel right now about these characters? [Warm, hopeful, connected. After chapters of darkness and loss, Sam represents a new beginning. The author is deliberately shifting the tone]

DO:
- Display the quote
- Use Think-Pair-Share: 20 seconds think, 30 seconds pair, share
- Draw attention to "for himself as well as Tom" -- Sam is not just a mentor figure; he needs hope too

TEACHER NOTES:
This pause point reveals character through dialogue and relationship. Sam's hope is not one-directional -- both characters need each other. This is sophisticated characterisation that targets SC1.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who only see Sam as helping Tom -- push: "The author says the hope is for Sam too. Why might Sam need hope?"
- Students who notice the tonal shift from the darkness of prison -- excellent awareness of authorial craft

[General: Pause Point 2 | VTLM 2.0: Deep Comprehension]`;

const NOTES_IDO_KPAS = `SAY:
- Now we are learning a practical writing skill: note-taking using KPAS
- KPAS stands for Key words, Phrases, Abbreviations, and Symbols
- When you take notes, you do NOT copy full sentences. You transform them -- pull out the important information and write it quickly
- Watch me. Here is a sentence from the text: "In chains, Tom and the other prisoners are transported by wagon to Plymouth where the first fleet ships are anchored"
- Step 1: Find the key words -- the words that carry the important information. Who? Tom and prisoners. What? Transported. Where? Plymouth. How? In chains, by wagon. Why? First fleet ships
- Step 2: Drop the little words -- "the", "and", "are", "by", "where"
- My notes: "Tom + prisoners, chained, transported wagon -> Plymouth, first fleet ships anchored"
- I used + for "and", -> for "leads to/results in"

DO:
- Display the full sentence and the KPAS conversion side by side
- Model the thinking: "I ask: who, what, when, where, why, how? Those are my key words"
- Show the abbreviations and symbols on the slide
- Think aloud: "I check -- can I reconstruct the meaning from my notes? Yes. Good notes let you rebuild the original idea"

TEACHER NOTES:
The I Do models the complete KPAS process with a novel-content sentence. The key metacognitive move is the reconstruction check -- can the student rebuild meaning from the notes?

MISCONCEPTIONS:
- Misconception: Note-taking means copying key sentences from the text
  Why: Students are used to highlighting or copying rather than transforming
  Impact: Notes become too long to be useful and students do not process the information
  Quick correction: "If your notes look like the original text, you have copied, not transformed. Good notes are SHORTER and use YOUR system of abbreviations and symbols"

WATCH FOR:
- Students who want to copy the whole sentence -- redirect: "Which words can you drop and still keep the meaning?"
- Students who drop too many words and lose meaning -- the reconstruction check catches this

[General: I Do -- Modelling | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Teaching / Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU = `SAY:
- Quick check. I will show you a sentence. You convert it to KPAS notes on your whiteboard
- "Once aboard the ship, Tom and the prisoners are ordered to strip and wash in half-barrels of seawater while their hair is clipped short to remove lice"
- Use key words, abbreviations and symbols. You have 30 seconds
- Hold up your boards! [Scan]

DO:
- Use Show Me Boards
- Scan for: key information captured (Tom + prisoners, strip + wash, seawater, hair clipped, remove lice)
- Scan for: appropriate use of symbols (+ for and, -> for results in)

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Show Me Boards

Script:
- "Convert this sentence to KPAS notes. 30 seconds"
- Count down, scan
- Look for: notes that are shorter than the original but capture who/what/where/why

PROCEED (>=80%): Most boards show transformed notes with key info captured. Move to We Do.
PIVOT (<80%): Most likely issue -- students copy most of the sentence instead of transforming it. Reteach: "Start with the questions: Who? Tom and prisoners. What happened? Ordered to strip and wash. In what? Seawater. What else? Hair clipped. Why? Remove lice. Now use symbols: Tom + prisoners, ordered strip + wash, seawater, hair clipped -> remove lice. That is half the length but keeps all the meaning." Re-check with a shorter sentence.

TEACHER NOTES:
Show Me Boards let every student demonstrate their KPAS attempt simultaneously. The model answer should be shared after scanning -- there is no single "correct" version, but all versions should be shorter than the original.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who copy word-for-word -- they need the "drop little words" strategy
- Students who over-abbreviate and lose meaning -- the reconstruction check helps
- Students who use creative but clear abbreviations -- celebrate and share

[General: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Formative Assessment]`;

const NOTES_CFU_REVEAL = `SAY:
- Here is one way to convert that sentence. Your version does not need to match exactly
- Model: "Tom + prisoners, ordered strip + wash, half-barrels seawater w/ carbolic soap, hair clipped -> remove lice"
- Check: can you rebuild the original meaning from these notes? [Yes] Then the notes work
- The key: notes should be SHORTER than the original but keep all the important information

DO:
- Reveal model KPAS conversion
- Compare with 2-3 student examples on whiteboards -- celebrate different valid approaches
- Transition to We Do on the worksheet

[General: CFU Reveal | VTLM 2.0: Formative Assessment]`;

const NOTES_WEDO = `SAY:
- On your worksheet, you have sentences from the novel. Convert each one to KPAS notes
- Remember: key words, phrases, abbreviations and symbols
- Use the abbreviation and symbol guide on the worksheet
- Let's do sentence 1 together. [Read it aloud, take suggestions, model the conversion on the board]
- Now complete sentences 2 through 5 independently. You have 8 minutes

DO:
- Distribute the Session 8 KPAS Note-Taking Worksheet
- Do sentence 1 collaboratively (We Do), then release for You Do
- Circulate -- check that students are transforming, not copying

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Provide the key words already underlined in the sentences. Students only need to write the underlined words with appropriate symbols. Reduces the cognitive load of identifying key information
- Extra Notes: Students can use the abbreviation guide on the worksheet for support

EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Write a short passage (3-4 sentences) summarising what happens in Chapters 18-19 using full sentences. Then convert your OWN passage into KPAS notes. Compare the two versions -- which is more efficient?

TEACHER NOTES:
The progression from We Do (sentence 1) to You Do (sentences 2-5) mirrors the gradual release. The worksheet includes a reference box of common abbreviations and symbols for student support.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who copy rather than transform -- the key question: "Is your version shorter?"
- Students who enjoy the efficiency of the system -- they will use it in Sessions 9-10
- Students finishing quickly -- direct to the extending passage task

[General: We Do / You Do | VTLM 2.0: Guided + Independent Practice]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- Success criteria check. SC1: identifying what Sam and Tom's dialogue reveals -- thumbs? [scan]
- SC2: explaining the effect of the "Down, down, down" repetition -- thumbs? [scan]
- SC3: converting sentences into KPAS notes -- thumbs? [scan]
- Turn and talk: Chapter 19 tells us Thomas became a grazier and a magistrate with a huge family. Knowing where Tom ends up, does that change how you feel about what he is going through now?

DO:
- Run through each SC with thumbs check
- The turn-and-talk connects the two timelines -- students reflect on how knowing the ending affects their experience of the journey
- Preview: "Next session we start reading about Tom's voyage AND we begin planning our information report about 18th century England"

TEACHER NOTES:
The closing question is about narrative structure -- knowing the ending changes how we read the middle. This is a sophisticated reader response concept.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who say "it makes it less sad because we know he survives" vs "it makes it more interesting because we see HOW he survived" -- both are valid
- Students "thumbs down" on SC3 -- KPAS will be practised again in Session 9

[General: Closing | VTLM 2.0: Review and Reflect]`;

const NOTES_RESOURCES = `SAY:
- Two printable resources today
- The ${WORKSHEET_RESOURCE.name} is for the KPAS note-taking activity
- The ${ANSWER_KEY_RESOURCE.name} is for teacher reference

DO:
- Print the worksheet before the lesson (one per student)
- Print the answer key (teacher copy only)

TEACHER NOTES:
The worksheet includes a reference box of common abbreviations and symbols. The answer key provides model KPAS conversions but emphasises that student versions may differ -- the test is whether meaning is preserved.
