  "",
  "TEACHER NOTES:",
  "Single 60-minute session combining Harmony Day (March 20) with RR emotional intensity content. The session moves through three connected activities: emotion statues game, Casey's Day roller coaster, and a group creative task. All group work is in pairs or small groups of 3-4.",

  "- Brief check: Thumbs up if you have heard the word 'intensity' before",
  "",
  "TEACHER NOTES:",

  "SAY:",
  "- Harmony Day is celebrated on March 20 every year across Australia",
  "- The message is: Everyone Belongs. It is about respect, inclusiveness, and a sense of belonging for everyone",
  "- Today we are connecting this to our emotions work. When we understand how people feel -- and how strongly they feel -- we become better at including and supporting everyone",
  "- Ask: Why might understanding emotional intensity help us be more inclusive? [When we recognise someone is feeling something strongly, we can respond with more care and empathy]",

  "- After each round, arrange half the class to observe the other half",

  "- Second event: Dad made a favourite breakfast. [Happy, pleased, grateful]. Is that a high or a low? [Definitely a high -- a positive moment]",

  "PROCEED: If 80%+ use an intensity word (not just 'sad' or 'angry'), proceed to the creative task.",
  "PIVOT: If most students write only basic emotion words, reteach: 'Sad is the family. But HOW sad? A little sad is disappointed. Very sad is devastated. Being picked last and hearing someone say you will make them lose -- that is not just sad. That is closer to humiliated or crushed.' Re-check with a second event.",
