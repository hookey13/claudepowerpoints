const NOTES_TITLE = `SAY:
- Session 8. We have order of operations and equivalent sentences with brackets
- Today we combine everything: finding unknowns in equations with brackets AND multiple operations
- This is the full algebra challenge

DO:
- Display title slide

TEACHER NOTES:
Session 8 of 10. Students find unknown values in equations that include brackets and combinations of all four operations. This is the core Level 6 outcome.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who are confident from Sessions 6-7

[General: Title | VTLM 2.0: Establishing Purpose]`;

const NOTES_DR_Q = `SAY:
- Daily review. Patterns and algorithms
- Find the pattern rule and the missing value

DO:
- Display problems, 90 seconds

TEACHER NOTES:
DR retrieves pattern work from a different strand.

WATCH FOR:
- Students applying multiplicative thinking to patterns

[Stage 1: Daily Review | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_DR_A = `SAY:
- Check your answers

DO:
- Reveal, self-check

TEACHER NOTES:
Quick tick-and-fix.

WATCH FOR:
- Pattern recognition fluency

[Stage 1: Daily Review Answers | VTLM 2.0: Retention and Recall]`;

const NOTES_FLUENCY = `SAY:
- Fluency -- mixed operations with brackets. Simplify each.

DO:
- Display 8 expressions, 2 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
Fluency drills order of operations with brackets -- prerequisite for today's unknown-finding.

WATCH FOR:
- Students processing brackets first consistently

[Stage 1: Fluency | VTLM 2.0: Automaticity]`;

const NOTES_LI_SC = `SAY:
- Read the learning intention
- Read from slide: "We are learning to find unknown values in equations that use brackets and multiple operations"
- Today is detective work with complex equations

DO:
- Choral read

TEACHER NOTES:
This lesson combines order of operations (Session 6) with unknown-finding (Session 4). The bracket adds a layer of complexity.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who connect this to the evaluate-target-solve strategy

[General: LI/SC | VTLM 2.0: Clear Learning Intention]`;

const NOTES_IDO1 = `SAY:
- Watch me. Find ?: 5 x (? + 3) = 40
- I know the whole expression equals 40. And 5 is multiplied by the bracket.
- So the bracket must equal 40 / 5 = 8.
- ? + 3 = 8. So ? = 5.
- Check: 5 x (5 + 3) = 5 x 8 = 40. Correct!
- The strategy: work backwards from the outside in.
- Start with what you know (the total), undo the outer operation, then solve the bracket.

DO:
- Write each step, showing the "working backwards" process
- Emphasise: undo the outer operation first

TEACHER NOTES:
"Working backwards" or "undoing" is the inverse-operation strategy. When the unknown is inside brackets, students must peel off the outer operation first, then solve what remains.

MISCONCEPTIONS:
- Misconception: Try to solve the bracket first (but you cannot because ? is unknown)
  Why: Students are trained to do brackets first (from Session 6) and try to evaluate (? + 3) directly
  Impact: Students get stuck because they cannot simplify an expression with an unknown
  Quick correction: "You are right that brackets usually go first. But here we CANNOT simplify the bracket because ? is unknown. Instead, work from the OUTSIDE in -- figure out what the bracket must equal by undoing the outer operation."

WATCH FOR:
- Students who try to do brackets first and get stuck -- redirect to "outside in"
- Students who see the inverse operation immediately

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_IDO2 = `SAY:
- Harder one. Find ?: 3 x ? + 7 = 25
- No brackets this time, but order of operations still matters
- I need to undo the operations in REVERSE order
- Last operation (in order of ops): + 7. Undo: 25 - 7 = 18.
- Previous operation: 3 x ?. So 3 x ? = 18. ? = 6.
- Check: 3 x 6 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25. Correct!

DO:
- Write each step
- Show the "reverse order of operations" strategy
- Emphasise: undo in REVERSE order

TEACHER NOTES:
When there are no brackets and the unknown is in a multiplication, students must identify the order of operations for the expression, then reverse it. Addition/subtraction (lowest priority) gets undone first, then multiplication/division.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who try to subtract 7 from both sides instinctively -- affirm this as correct inverse thinking
- Students who try to divide 25 by 3 first -- they are not reversing the order correctly

[Stage 2: I Do | VTLM 2.0: Explicit Modelling]`;

const NOTES_CFU1 = `SAY:
- Quick check. Find ?: 4 x (? + 2) = 28
- Work backwards: what must the bracket equal? Then find ?.
- 15 seconds.

DO:
- Students write on whiteboards
- Scan for ? = 5

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Show Me Boards
Script:
- Say: "4 x (? + 2) = 28. Work backwards. Show me."
- Scan for: 5 (bracket = 28/4 = 7, then ? + 2 = 7, ? = 5).
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 5, continue.
PIVOT: Most likely error -- students write 7 (they found the bracket value but forgot to subtract 2). Reteach: "Good -- you found the bracket equals 7. But ? + 2 = 7. ? is not 7 -- ? is 7 minus 2. ? = 5."

TEACHER NOTES:
Tests the two-step backwards solving: undo outer operation, then solve the bracket.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who stop at 7 (bracket value) without finishing
- Students who get 5 with full working

[Stage 2: CFU | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_Q = `SAY:
- With your partner, find the unknown in each equation
- Work backwards from what you know
- Show all steps

DO:
- Display four problems, 3 minutes

TEACHER NOTES:
We Do mixes bracket unknowns and non-bracket unknowns. Students must choose the right approach.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:
ENABLING PROMPT:
- Task: Use Session 8 Enabling Scaffold which guides each step: (1) identify the outer operation, (2) undo it, (3) solve what remains. First two problems are modelled.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 8 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Multi-step equations with two unknowns. Given 2 x ? + 3 x triangle = 26, and knowing triangle = 4, find ?. Then create your own two-unknown equations.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 8 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who solve bracket equations but struggle without brackets
- Readiness signal: completing all four with clear working

[Stage 3: We Do | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_WEDO_A = `SAY:
- Let's check.
- 1: 6 x (? + 1) = 42. Bracket = 42/6 = 7. ?+1 = 7. ? = 6.
- 2: 2 x ? - 5 = 11. Undo -5: 2x? = 16. ? = 8.
- 3: (? - 3) x 5 = 35. Bracket = 35/5 = 7. ?-3 = 7. ? = 10.
- 4: 48 / (? + 2) = 8. Bracket = 48/8 = 6. ?+2 = 6. ? = 4.

DO:
- Reveal one at a time, cold call

TEACHER NOTES:
Problem 4 uses division with the bracket as divisor -- this requires recognising 48/bracket = 8, so bracket = 48/8 = 6.

WATCH FOR:
- Problem 4 errors (students dividing 48 by 2 instead of finding what bracket equals)

[Stage 3: We Do Answers | VTLM 2.0: Scaffold Practice]`;

const NOTES_CFU2 = `SAY:
- Hinge. Find ?: 5 x ? + 10 = 45
- Finger vote for the answer.
- 1 finger: ? = 7    2 fingers: ? = 9    3 fingers: ? = 5    4 fingers: ? = 8

DO:
- Students vote

CFU CHECKPOINT:
Technique: Finger Voting
Script:
- Say: "5 x ? + 10 = 45. Vote: 1=7, 2=9, 3=5, 4=8."
- Scan for: 1 finger (? = 7). Undo +10: 5x? = 35. ? = 7.
PROCEED: If 80%+ show 1 finger, move to You Do.
PIVOT: Students choose 2 (? = 9, from 45/5 = 9 -- they divided without undoing the +10 first). Reteach: "Order matters. In 5x?+10, the +10 happens LAST in order of operations. So undo it FIRST: 45-10=35. Now 5x?=35. ?=7."

TEACHER NOTES:
Distractor 2 (9) is from dividing 45/5 directly without undoing +10. This tests whether students understand reverse order.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who chose 2 -- they need the reverse-order concept reinforced

[Stage 3: CFU Hinge | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_YOUDO = `SAY:
- Independent practice. Mixed equations with unknowns.
- Show all working using the backwards strategy.
- 8 minutes.

- Distribute worksheet, circulate

TEACHER NOTES:
You Do has different numbers from We Do.

ENABLING & EXTENDING:

- Task: Guided step-by-step scaffold.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 8 Enabling Scaffold PDF.
EXTENDING PROMPT:
- Task: Two-unknown equations investigation.
- Extra Notes: Distribute Session 8 Extension PDF.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who show clear working vs those who guess
- Readiness signal: completing 8+ problems correctly

[Stage 4: You Do | VTLM 2.0: Supported Application]`;

const NOTES_EXIT = `SAY:
- Exit ticket. 3 questions. 3 minutes.

DO:
- Display, collect

TEACHER NOTES:
Q1: bracket unknown. Q2: no-bracket unknown with order of ops. Q3: explain strategy.

WATCH FOR:
- Q2 errors (reverse-order mistakes)

[Stage 5: Exit Ticket | VTLM 2.0: Monitor Progress]`;

const NOTES_CLOSING = `SAY:
- SC check. Thumbs.
- SC1: I can find unknowns inside brackets. Thumbs?
- SC2: I can find unknowns in multi-operation equations. Thumbs?
- SC3: I can explain the backwards strategy. Thumbs?
- Turn and talk: When you see an equation with an unknown, what is your first step?

DO:
- Thumbs, Turn and Talk, cold call

TEACHER NOTES:
The Turn and Talk targets strategy articulation. "Work backwards from what you know" is the key insight.

WATCH FOR:
- Students who articulate "undo the last operation first"
